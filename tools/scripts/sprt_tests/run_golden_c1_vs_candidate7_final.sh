SPRT Test: Golden C1 vs Candidate 7 (QUIESCENCE FINALLY ENABLED)
================================================================
Date: $(date)
Purpose: Validate that enabling ENABLE_QUIESCENCE flag solves the mystery

THE DISCOVERY:
- Quiescence search was NEVER compiled in (missing ENABLE_QUIESCENCE flag)
- All previous builds fell back to static evaluation
- Golden binary had the flag manually added during development

Golden C1 Binary: ${ENGINE_GOLDEN}
  - The original working binary
  - Size: ${GOLDEN_SIZE} bytes (411,336)
  - MD5: ${GOLDEN_MD5}
  - Version: ${GOLDEN_VERSION}
  - Has quiescence search compiled in

Candidate 7 Binary: ${ENGINE_C7}
  - Fixed build with ENABLE_QUIESCENCE defined
  - Size: ${C7_SIZE} bytes (should be ~411KB)
  - MD5: ${C7_MD5}
  - Version: ${C7_VERSION}
  - Finally has quiescence search enabled!

Time Control: ${TIME_CONTROL}
SPRT Parameters:
  - H0: ELO difference within [-20, 20]
  - H1: ELO difference outside [-20, 20]
  - Alpha: ${ALPHA}, Beta: ${BETA}
  - Very tight bounds - they should be nearly identical
Opening Book: 4moves_test.pgn

Expected Results:
  - Binary sizes should match (~411KB)
  - Performance should be nearly identical
  - This proves quiescence was the missing piece

The Fix Applied:
  Added to CMakeLists.txt:
  - add_compile_definitions(ENABLE_QUIESCENCE)
  - add_compile_definitions(ENABLE_MVV_LVA)
