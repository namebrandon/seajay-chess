SPRT Test: Stage 11 vs Stage 10 (Drawkiller Book)
==================================================
Date: $(date)
Test Engine: Stage 11 (MVV-LVA)
Base Engine: Stage 10 (Magic Bitboards)

Opening Book: Drawkiller_balanced_big.epd
Book Characteristics:
- 15,962 sharp tactical positions
- Opposite-side castling positions
- ~63% draw rate (vs 83% for standard books)
- Favors tactical play where move ordering matters most

Expected Improvement: +50 to +100 Elo
SPRT Parameters: elo0=$ELO0, elo1=$ELO1, alpha=$ALPHA, beta=$BETA
Time Control: $TIME_CONTROL

Stage 11 Features:
- MVV-LVA move ordering for captures
- Expected 15-30% node reduction
- Better alpha-beta pruning efficiency
- Should excel in tactical positions

Stage 10 Features:
- Magic bitboards for move generation
- Optimized perft performance
- No move ordering beyond basic captures

Why Drawkiller for this test:
1. Sharp positions emphasize importance of move ordering
2. Tactical nature should show MVV-LVA benefits clearly
3. Large position count (15,962) eliminates determinism
4. Lower draw rate improves statistical efficiency
5. Opposite-side castling creates attacking games
