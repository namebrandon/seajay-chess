SPRT Test: Stage 11 vs Stage 10 (Drawkiller + 60s)
===================================================
Date: $(date)
Test Engine: Stage 11 (MVV-LVA)
Base Engine: Stage 10 (Magic Bitboards)

Test Configuration:
- Time Control: 60+0.6 (10x longer than initial tests)
- Opening Book: Drawkiller_balanced_big.epd
- Book Size: 15,962 sharp tactical positions
- Expected Search Depth: 10-14+ ply
- Draw Rate: ~63% (vs 85% in quiet positions)

Hypothesis:
Combining tactical positions with deep search should maximize MVV-LVA benefits.
Previous tests showed negative results at shallow depths (6-8 ply).
At depth 10+, in tactical positions, MVV-LVA should excel.

SPRT Parameters: elo0=$ELO0, elo1=$ELO1, alpha=$ALPHA, beta=$BETA

Why This Should Work:
1. Tactical positions have many captures to order
2. Deep search amortizes sorting overhead
3. Sharp positions make move ordering critical
4. Opposite-side castling creates attacking races

Previous Results Summary:
- 10+0.1 with 4moves: -2.9 Elo
- 10+0.1 with Drawkiller: -8.7 Elo
- Both at depth 6-8 where overhead > benefit

Stage 11 Features:
- MVV-LVA move ordering for captures
- Expected 15-30% node reduction at depth 10+
- Should excel in tactical positions

Stage 10 Features:
- Magic bitboards for move generation
- Natural move ordering from generator

Results:
See sprt_output.txt for detailed results
