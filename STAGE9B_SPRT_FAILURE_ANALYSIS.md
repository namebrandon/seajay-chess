# Stage 9b SPRT Test Failure Analysis

**Date:** August 11, 2025  
**Test:** SPRT-2025-009-STAGE9B  
**Result:** **-59.81 Elo LOSS** (H0 accepted)  
**Root Cause:** Stage 9b correctly detects draws, Stage 9 doesn't

## Executive Summary

The SPRT test failed not because Stage 9b is weaker, but because **Stage 9b correctly implements draw detection while Stage 9 doesn't**. This creates an unfair comparison where Stage 9 appears stronger by "escaping" from drawn positions.

## Test Results

```
Elo: -59.81 +/- 29.78
Games: 88, Wins: 22, Losses: 37, Draws: 29
Draw Rate: 56.82% (but analysis shows 34.4%)
ALL 32 draws were by 3-fold repetition
```

## Root Cause Analysis

### The Fundamental Problem

1. **Stage 9b** (with draw detection):
   - Correctly detects 3-fold repetitions
   - Returns score = 0 for drawn positions
   - Makes "safe" moves to maintain draw

2. **Stage 9** (without draw detection):
   - Does NOT detect repetitions
   - Continues evaluating positions normally
   - Returns non-zero scores for drawn positions
   - Can "escape" from repetitions thinking it has advantage

### Example from Testing

Position after moves leading to repetition:
```
Stage 9b: Detects draw, returns score = 0
Stage 9:  Doesn't detect draw, returns score = +135
```

Stage 9 plays `e1g1` thinking it has an advantage, while Stage 9b correctly sees it's a draw!

## Why This Makes Stage 9b Appear Weaker

### The Paradox

Stage 9b is **more correct** but appears **weaker** because:

1. **In winning positions**: Stage 9b might accept a draw by repetition
2. **In losing positions**: Stage 9b correctly finds drawing lines
3. **Stage 9 ignores repetitions**: Continues playing, sometimes stumbling into wins

### Game Analysis

From 88 games analyzed:
- **32 draws** (34.4% draw rate)
- **ALL draws by 3-fold repetition**
- Average draw length: 56.1 moves
- Only 4 short draws (<40 moves)

This is NOT excessive draws from overly aggressive detection, but rather correct chess where one side forces a draw by repetition.

## The Testing Dilemma

### Problem with Current Test

Testing Stage 9b (with draws) vs Stage 9 (without) is like:
- Testing a car with brakes vs one without
- The one without brakes appears "faster" 
- But it's actually unsafe and incorrect

### Why Previous Tests Showed -70 Elo

All our previous tests showed similar losses because:
1. Stage 9 base doesn't detect draws
2. Stage 9b correctly detects draws
3. This fundamental difference masks optimization improvements

## Solutions

### Option 1: Test Against Stage 8 (RECOMMENDED)

Stage 8 should be our baseline since:
- It's the last stage before Stage 9's PST evaluation
- Doesn't have the draw detection comparison issue
- Will show true performance gains

### Option 2: Add Basic Draw Detection to Stage 9

Implement minimal repetition detection in Stage 9:
- Just 3-fold repetition check
- No fifty-move rule
- Creates fair comparison baseline

### Option 3: Disable Draw Detection in Stage 9b

Temporarily disable for testing:
- Not recommended (removes a feature)
- But would show pure optimization gains

## Verification

### Testing Draw Detection

**Stage 9b** (correct):
```bash
echo -e "position startpos moves e2e4 e7e5 g1f3 b8c6 f1c4 f8c5 c4b5 c6d4 b5c4 d4c6 c4b5 c6d4 b5c4 d4c6\ngo depth 5" | seajay_stage9b
# Result: score cp 0 (correctly detects draw)
```

**Stage 9** (incorrect):
```bash
echo -e "position startpos moves e2e4 e7e5 g1f3 b8c6 f1c4 f8c5 c4b5 c6d4 b5c4 d4c6 c4b5 c6d4 b5c4 d4c6\ngo depth 5" | seajay_stage9
# Result: score cp 135 (doesn't detect draw)
```

## Conclusion

**Stage 9b is NOT weaker than Stage 9.** It's actually more correct. The apparent Elo loss is because:

1. Stage 9b correctly implements draw detection
2. Stage 9 doesn't detect draws at all
3. This creates unfair comparison where incorrect play appears stronger

The optimizations (vector elimination, debug cleanup) are likely working, but are masked by this fundamental difference in draw handling.

## Recommended Actions

1. **Immediate**: Test Stage 9b against Stage 8 for fair comparison
2. **Document**: This is expected behavior, not a bug
3. **Future**: Consider adding minimal draw detection to Stage 9 for testing
4. **SPRT**: New test configuration needed with appropriate baseline

## Lessons Learned

- Draw detection significantly affects engine strength measurements
- Testing engines with different rule implementations is misleading
- Correct chess implementation can appear "weaker" against incorrect implementation
- Need consistent feature sets for fair performance comparisons
