================================================
Date: 2025-09-02
Branch: feature/20250902-pruning-optimization
Commit: 89d9363

Depth 10 Search from Starting Position:
- Nodes: 332,267
- Time: 0.224s
- NPS: 1,483,334

Pruning Stats (from SearchStats):
- Futility pruned: 30,822
- Move count pruned: 19,437
- Null move attempts: 6,924 (38.5% cutoff rate)

Key Issue: No futility pruning at depth 7+ (fut_b would show [lots,some,0,0])
