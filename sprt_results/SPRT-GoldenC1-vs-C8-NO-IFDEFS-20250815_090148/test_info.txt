SPRT Test: Golden C1 vs Candidate 8 (All IFDEFs Removed)
=========================================================
Date: Fri Aug 15 09:01:49 AM CDT 2025
Purpose: Validate that removing dangerous compile-time feature flags doesn't affect performance

THE LESSON LEARNED:
- Compile-time feature flags are dangerous
- They can accidentally disable entire features
- All features should compile in and be controlled via UCI options
- This prevents the "4 hours chasing ghosts" scenario

Golden C1 Binary: /workspace/binaries/seajay-stage14-sprt-candidate1-GOLDEN
  - The original working binary
  - Size: 411336 bytes (411,336)
  - MD5: 0b0ea4c7f8f0aa60079a2ccc2997bf88
  - Version: id name SeaJay Stage-14-SPRT-Candidate-1 (Quiescence: PRODUCTION MODE)
  - Has quiescence and MVV-LVA compiled in

Candidate 8 Binary: /workspace/binaries/seajay-stage14-sprt-candidate8-NO-IFDEFS
  - Fixed build with ifdefs removed, UCI control only
  - Size: 411384 bytes (should be ~411KB)
  - MD5: 140d5a938051f0cfcc2c5819e6aa1832
  - Version: id name SeaJay Stage-14-SPRT-Candidate-8-NO-IFDEFS (Quiescence: PRODUCTION MODE)
  - All features always compile in, controlled via UCI

Changes in Candidate 8:
1. Removed #ifdef ENABLE_QUIESCENCE from negamax.cpp
2. Removed #ifdef ENABLE_MVV_LVA from quiescence.cpp
3. Removed #define ENABLE_MVV_LVA from move_ordering.h
4. All features now controlled via UCI options, not compile flags

Time Control: 10+0.1
SPRT Parameters:
  - H0: ELO difference within [-20, 20]
  - H1: ELO difference outside [-20, 20]
  - Alpha: 0.05, Beta: 0.05
  - Very tight bounds - they should be identical
Opening Book: 4moves_test.pgn

Expected Results:
  - Binary sizes should match (~411KB)
  - Performance should be identical
  - This proves UCI control is the right approach
