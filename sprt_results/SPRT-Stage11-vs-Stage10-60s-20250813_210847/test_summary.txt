SPRT Test: Stage 11 vs Stage 10 (60 Second Time Control)
=========================================================
Date: Wed Aug 13 09:21:47 PM CDT 2025
Test Engine: Stage 11 (MVV-LVA)
Base Engine: Stage 10 (Magic Bitboards)

Time Control: 60+0.6 (10x longer than initial tests)
Expected Search Depth: 10-14+ ply

Hypothesis:
MVV-LVA showed -2.5 Elo at 10+0.1 time control (depth 6-8).
Testing whether benefits emerge at deeper search depths where:
- Overhead is amortized over more nodes
- Better move ordering has more impact
- Alpha-beta pruning benefits compound

SPRT Parameters: elo0=0, elo1=30, alpha=0.05, beta=0.05

Stage 11 Features:
- MVV-LVA move ordering for captures
- Expected 15-30% node reduction at depth 10+
- Better alpha-beta pruning efficiency

Stage 10 Features:
- Magic bitboards for move generation
- Natural move ordering from generator

Previous Results (10+0.1):
- Elo: -2.5 to -2.9
- Draw Rate: 85%
- LLR: Trending toward FAIL
