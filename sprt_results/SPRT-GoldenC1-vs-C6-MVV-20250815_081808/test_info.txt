SPRT Test: Golden C1 vs Candidate 6 (MVV-LVA Enabled)
======================================================
Date: Fri Aug 15 08:18:08 AM CDT 2025
Purpose: Validate that MVV-LVA was the critical missing component

Golden C1 Binary: /workspace/binaries/seajay-stage14-sprt-candidate1-GOLDEN
  - Original binary with MVV-LVA (uncommitted)
  - Size: 411,336 bytes
  - MD5: 0b0ea4c7f8f0aa60079a2ccc2997bf88
  - Version: id name SeaJay Stage-14-SPRT-Candidate-1 (Quiescence: PRODUCTION MODE)

Candidate 6 Binary: /workspace/binaries/seajay-stage14-sprt-candidate6-mvvlva
  - Rebuilt with MVV-LVA properly enabled
  - Size: 402648 bytes
  - MD5: bbd0a6663ff254c00b8f14401216668a
  - Version: id name SeaJay Stage-14-SPRT-Candidate-6-MVV-LVA (Quiescence: PRODUCTION MODE)

Time Control: 10+0.1
SPRT Parameters:
  - H0 (null): ELO difference within [-30, 30]
  - H1 (alternative): ELO difference outside [-30, 30]
  - Alpha: 0.05, Beta: 0.05
Opening Book: 4moves_test.pgn

Expected Results:
  - If MVV-LVA was the key: Similar performance (H0 accepted)
  - If other factors matter: Golden C1 still stronger

Discovery:
  Symbol analysis revealed Golden C1 has 27 MVV-LVA related symbols
  that were missing from all rebuilt binaries. This explains the
  27KB size difference and +301 ELO performance gap.
