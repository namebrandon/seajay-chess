===========================================
Test ID: SPRT-2025-010-STAGE9B-STARTPOS
Date: 2025-08-11_07-11-41
Testing: Stage9b-Optimized vs Stage9-Baseline
Opening: STARTPOS (no book)

Binary Paths:
- Test: /workspace/bin/seajay_stage9b_optimized
- Base: /workspace/bin/seajay_stage9_baseline

SPRT Parameters:
- Elo bounds: [0, 30]
- Alpha: 0.05
- Beta: 0.05
- Time control: 10+0.1
- Max rounds: 2000

Key Differences from Book Test:
- Using startpos for all games
- Tests pure engine strength from initial position
- May show different draw rates
- No opening variety influence

Expected Outcome:
- Stage 9b should show +20-40 Elo from vector optimization
- Draw rate may differ from book test
- NPS improvement should translate to stronger play

Optimization Applied:
- Dual-mode history system eliminating heap allocations during search
- Zero vector operations in hot path
- Stack-based repetition detection in search mode
