SPRT Test: Golden C1 vs Candidate 7 (QUIESCENCE FINALLY ENABLED)
================================================================
Date: Fri Aug 15 08:48:35 AM CDT 2025
Purpose: Validate that enabling ENABLE_QUIESCENCE flag solves the mystery

THE DISCOVERY:
- Quiescence search was NEVER compiled in (missing ENABLE_QUIESCENCE flag)
- All previous builds fell back to static evaluation
- Golden binary had the flag manually added during development

Golden C1 Binary: /workspace/binaries/seajay-stage14-sprt-candidate1-GOLDEN
  - The original working binary
  - Size: 411336 bytes (411,336)
  - MD5: 0b0ea4c7f8f0aa60079a2ccc2997bf88
  - Version: id name SeaJay Stage-14-SPRT-Candidate-1 (Quiescence: PRODUCTION MODE)
  - Has quiescence search compiled in

Candidate 7 Binary: /workspace/binaries/seajay-stage14-sprt-candidate7-FIXED
  - Fixed build with ENABLE_QUIESCENCE defined
  - Size: 411384 bytes (should be ~411KB)
  - MD5: ac90815d24bb02bb8dcd911ff20dcc2c
  - Version: id name SeaJay Stage-14-SPRT-Candidate-7-QUIESCENCE-FIXED (Quiescence: PRODUCTION MODE)
  - Finally has quiescence search enabled!

Time Control: 10+0.1
SPRT Parameters:
  - H0: ELO difference within [-20, 20]
  - H1: ELO difference outside [-20, 20]
  - Alpha: 0.05, Beta: 0.05
  - Very tight bounds - they should be nearly identical
Opening Book: 4moves_test.pgn

Expected Results:
  - Binary sizes should match (~411KB)
  - Performance should be nearly identical
  - This proves quiescence was the missing piece

The Fix Applied:
  Added to CMakeLists.txt:
  - add_compile_definitions(ENABLE_QUIESCENCE)
  - add_compile_definitions(ENABLE_MVV_LVA)
