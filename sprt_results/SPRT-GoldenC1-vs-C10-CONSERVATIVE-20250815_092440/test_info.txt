SPRT Test: Golden C1 vs Candidate 10 (Conservative Improvements)
================================================================
Date: Fri Aug 15 09:24:41 AM CDT 2025
Purpose: Test conservative improvements after C9's catastrophic failure

LESSONS LEARNED FROM C9 FAILURE:
- Delta margin of 200cp was catastrophically low
- SeaJay needs 900cp margin to see queen captures
- Aggressive pruning causes tactical blindness
- Engine-specific tuning is critical

IMPROVEMENTS IN C10:
1. Reverted Delta Margins (Critical Fix)
   - DELTA_MARGIN: 200 → 900 centipawns (back to Golden)
   - DELTA_MARGIN_ENDGAME: 150 → 600 centipawns (back to Golden)
   - DELTA_MARGIN_PANIC: 100 → 400 centipawns (conservative)

2. Moderate Check Ply Reduction
   - MAX_CHECK_PLY: 8 → 6 plies (balanced)
   - Not as aggressive as C9's reduction to 3

3. Time Pressure Panic Mode (Retained)
   - Activates when time < 100ms
   - But with conservative 400cp margin
   - Max captures → 8 per node

  - Version: id name SeaJay Stage-14-SPRT-Candidate-10-CONSERVATIVE (Quiescence: PRODUCTION MODE)
  - Expected: 0-10 ELO improvement

Time Control: 10+0.1
SPRT Parameters:
  - H0: ELO difference within [-10, 10]
  - H1: ELO difference outside [-10, 10]
  - Alpha: 0.05, Beta: 0.05
