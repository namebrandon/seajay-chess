SPRT Test Configuration
=======================
Test ID: SPRT-2025-011-STAGE9B-CLEAN
Date: 2025-08-11_07-44-34
Testing: Stage9b-Optimized vs Stage9-Baseline

Binary Paths:
- Test: /workspace/bin/seajay_stage9b_optimized
- Base: /workspace/bin/seajay_stage9_baseline

SPRT Parameters:
- Elo bounds: [0, 35]
- Alpha: 0.05
- Beta: 0.05
- Time control: 10+0.1
- Max rounds: 2000

Expected Outcome:
- Stage 9b should show +20-40 Elo from vector optimization
- Draw rate should normalize to 30-40% (vs 70%+ in previous tests)
- NPS improvement should translate to stronger play

Optimization Applied:
- Dual-mode history system eliminating heap allocations during search
- Zero vector operations in hot path
- Stack-based repetition detection in search mode
