======================================================
Date: Thu Aug 14 04:23:48 PM CDT 2025
Stage 13 Binary: /workspace/binaries/seajay-stage13-sprt
Stage 12 Binary: /workspace/binaries/seajay-stage12-baseline
Time Control: 60+0.6 seconds
SPRT Parameters:
  - H0 (null): ELO difference <= 60
  - H1 (alternative): ELO difference >= 90
  - Alpha (Type I error): 0.05
  - Beta (Type II error): 0.05
Opening Book: 4moves_test.pgn
Expected Result: H1 accepted (+60-95 Elo improvement)
Note: Longer time controls may show stronger improvement due to:
  - Better time management effectiveness
  - More iterations benefiting from aspiration windows
  - Stability detection more impactful with more time
Features Tested:
  - Aspiration windows (16cp initial, progressive widening)
  - Dynamic time management with stability detection
  - Enhanced UCI output with iteration details
  - Branching factor tracking and prediction
  - Performance optimizations
