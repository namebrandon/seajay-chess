SPRT Test: Golden C1 vs Rebuilt C1
=====================================
Date: Fri Aug 15 07:34:44 AM CDT 2025
Purpose: Determine if uncommitted changes in golden C1 were responsible for +300 ELO

Golden C1 Binary: /workspace/binaries/seajay-stage14-sprt-candidate1-GOLDEN
  - The original binary that showed +300 ELO gain
  - Size: 411,336 bytes
  - MD5: 0b0ea4c7f8f0aa60079a2ccc2997bf88
  - Version: id name SeaJay Stage-14-SPRT-Candidate-1 (Quiescence: PRODUCTION MODE)
  - Contains uncommitted changes not in git

Rebuilt C1 Binary: /workspace/binaries/seajay-stage14-rebuilt-from-ce52720
  - Rebuilt from commit ce52720
  - Size: 384,312 bytes  
  - MD5: bb8cc3875f10c371d41842fbaecc114a
  - Version: id name SeaJay Stage-14-SPRT-Candidate-1 (Quiescence: PRODUCTION MODE)
  - Built from exact commit code

Time Control: 10+0.1
SPRT Parameters:
  - H0 (null): ELO difference <= 0
  - H1 (alternative): ELO difference >= 50
  - Alpha (Type I error): 0.05
  - Beta (Type II error): 0.05
Opening Book: 4moves_test.pgn

Expected Results:
  - If uncommitted changes were critical: Golden C1 will dominate
  - If uncommitted changes were minor: Similar performance
  - This test isolates the impact of the missing 27KB of code

Key Questions:
1. Were the uncommitted changes functional improvements?
2. Or were they debug/logging code that happened to help?
3. Can we reverse-engineer what made golden C1 special?
