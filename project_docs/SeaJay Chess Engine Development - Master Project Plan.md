# SeaJay Chess Engine Development - Master Project Plan

## Project Overview

This comprehensive project plan outlines a methodical, modular approach to building a competitive chess engine incorporating modern NNUE evaluation. The plan emphasizes incremental development with continuous statistical validation, ensuring each component contributes measurably to engine strength before proceeding to the next phase.

## Development Philosophy

**Single Feature Focus**: Each development stage implements exactly one feature with complete testing and validation before proceeding to the next stage.

**Statistical Validation**: From Phase 2 onwards, all improvements must pass Sequential Probability Ratio Test (SPRT) validation to ensure genuine strength gains.

**Early Playability**: The engine will be playable through standard chess GUIs from Phase 1, Stage 3, enabling continuous testing and motivation throughout development.

**Hybrid Architecture**: Combines bitboard and mailbox representations from inception to optimize both move generation speed and position evaluation efficiency.

**Performance First**: Given that chess engine success is often a function of speed, we prioritize performant solutions, implementing in C++ and utilizing appropriate optimization techniques throughout development.

**Historical Journaling**: We track our development efforts, doing our best to create a journal or diary so that others who wish to follow along, or better understand our efforts and review what decisions we made and what steps we took during this development effort.
