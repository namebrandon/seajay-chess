# SeaJay Chess Engine - Deferred Items Tracker

**Purpose:** Track items deferred from earlier stages and items being deferred to future stages  
**Last Updated:** August 9, 2025  

## Items FROM Stage 1 TO Stage 2

After reviewing Stage 1 implementation, the following was already completed but needs enhancement:

### Already Implemented (But Needs Enhancement):
1. **Basic FEN Parser** (`Board::fromFEN`)
   - ✅ Basic parsing exists
   - ⚠️ Needs: Error reporting with Result<T,E> type
   - ⚠️ Needs: Parse-to-temp-validate-swap pattern
   - ⚠️ Needs: Buffer overflow protection

2. **FEN Generator** (`Board::toFEN`) 
   - ✅ Basic implementation exists
   - ✅ Appears complete

3. **Board Display** (`Board::toString`)
   - ✅ Basic ASCII display exists
   - ⚠️ Could add: Unicode piece display option
   - ⚠️ Could add: Debug display with bitboards

4. **Basic Validation**
   - ✅ `validatePosition()` - basic implementation
   - ✅ `validateKings()` - both kings present
   - ✅ `validatePieceCounts()` - material limits
   - ✅ `validateEnPassant()` - basic EP validation
   - ✅ `validateCastlingRights()` - basic castling validation
   - ⚠️ Missing: Side not to move in check validation
   - ⚠️ Missing: Bitboard/mailbox sync validation
   - ⚠️ Missing: Zobrist validation

### Not Yet Implemented:
5. **Zobrist Rebuild After FEN**
   - Currently incrementally updates during parsing
   - Needs: Complete rebuild from scratch after successful parse

## Items DEFERRED FROM Stage 2 TO Future Stages

### To Stage 4 (Move Generation):
1. **En Passant Pin Validation**
   - Complex validation where EP capture would expose king to check
   - Test positions documented in stage2_position_management_plan.md
   - Reason: Expensive computation, needs attack generation

2. **Triple Check Validation**
   - Validating position doesn't have impossible triple check
   - Reason: Requires attack generation to verify

3. **Full Legality Check**
   - Checking if position is reachable from starting position
   - Reason: Complex retrograde analysis, not critical

### To Stage 3 (UCI):
1. **UCI Position Command**
   - Will use FEN parser to set up positions
   - Dependency: Robust FEN parsing from Stage 2

### To Stage 5 (Testing):
1. **Perft Test Positions**
   - Will use FEN parser to load test positions
   - Dependency: 100% accurate FEN parsing

## Tracking Mechanism

### How We Ensure Nothing Is Forgotten:

1. **Code Comments**: Add TODO comments at relevant locations
```cpp
// TODO(Stage4): Implement en passant pin validation
// See: deferred_items_tracker.md for details
```

2. **Stage Planning Documents**: Each stage plan should review this tracker
```markdown
## Prerequisites Check
- [ ] Review deferred_items_tracker.md for incoming items
- [ ] Update tracker with newly deferred items
```

3. **Test Placeholders**: Create disabled tests for deferred items
```cpp
TEST(Board, DISABLED_EnPassantPinValidation) {
    // TODO(Stage4): Enable when attack generation available
    const char* fen = "8/2p5/3p4/KP5r/8/8/8/8 w - c6 0 1";
    // Test will verify b5xc6 is illegal (exposes king)
}
```

4. **Project Status Updates**: Reference this tracker in project_status.md

## Phase 1 Completion Status

**Analysis Date:** August 11, 2025
**Source:** stage9b_regression_analysis.md

### Architecture Refactoring (Phase 3+):

1. **Proper Separation of Game vs Search History**
   - **Current:** Board class mixes game and search history
   - **Target:** Separate GameController and SearchThread classes
   - **Benefit:** Clean architecture, no search/game state mixing
   - **Reference:** Lines 164-194 of regression analysis
   ```cpp
   // Future architecture:
   // GameController - handles game moves and history
   // SearchThread - handles search with pre-allocated stack
   // Board - pure position state, no history
   ```

2. **Pre-allocated Search Stack Pattern**
   - **Current:** Using SearchInfo with fixed array (good)
   - **Enhancement:** Full Stockfish-style StateInfo pattern
   - **Benefit:** Zero heap allocations during search
   - **Reference:** Lines 27-32 of regression analysis

### Performance Optimizations (Phase 3):

3. **Incremental Material Tracking**
   - **Current:** Material recalculated on demand
   - **Target:** Update incrementally during make/unmake
   - **Benefit:** Avoid redundant calculations
   - **Reference:** Line 200 of regression analysis

4. **Smart Eval Cache Invalidation**
   - **Current:** Cache invalidated on every move
   - **Target:** Selective invalidation based on move type
   - **Benefit:** Better cache utilization
   - **Reference:** Line 201 of regression analysis

5. **Remove Bounds Checking in Release Builds**
   - **Current:** Vector bounds checks always active
   - **Target:** Use asserts only in debug builds
   - **Benefit:** Reduced overhead in hot path
   - **Reference:** Line 202 of regression analysis

6. **Ensure No Virtual Function Calls in Hot Path**
   - **Current:** makeMove/unmakeMove are not virtual (good)
   - **Verify:** Keep monitoring this in future refactoring
   - **Reference:** Line 203 of regression analysis

### Advanced Performance Features (Phase 4+):

7. **Hash Table Prefetching**
   - **Future:** Prefetch transposition table entries
   - **Benefit:** Hide memory latency
   - **Reference:** Line 206 of regression analysis

8. **Branch Prediction Hints**
   - **Target:** Use [[likely]]/[[unlikely]] C++20 attributes
   - **Benefit:** Better CPU branch prediction
   - **Reference:** Line 207 of regression analysis

9. **SIMD Bitboard Operations**
   - **Target:** Use AVX2/SSE for bitboard operations
   - **Benefit:** Parallel bit manipulation
   - **Reference:** Line 208 of regression analysis

10. **Copy-Make Pattern Investigation**
    - **Research:** Test copy-make vs make/unmake
    - **Benefit:** May be faster for simple positions
    - **Reference:** Lines 209, 251 of regression analysis

### Monitoring and Testing Infrastructure:

11. **Regular Performance Profiling**
    - **Tool:** perf on Linux, Instruments on macOS
    - **Frequency:** After each major change
    - **Target:** makeMove < 5% of runtime
    - **Reference:** Lines 221-224 of regression analysis

12. **Nodes Per Second Benchmarking**
    - **Target:** 2-5M nps on modern hardware
    - **Current:** Need to measure after fix
    - **Reference:** Lines 217-219 of regression analysis

### Already Implemented from Analysis:

✅ **Immediate Fix Applied (August 11, 2025):**
- Added m_inSearch flag to Board class
- Conditional history updates (skip during search)
- Maintained draw detection functionality
- **Result:** Ready for SPRT testing to verify ~70 Elo recovery

### Priority Ranking for Future Work:

**High Priority (Phase 3):**
- Items 3, 4, 5 (Performance optimizations)
- Item 11 (Regular profiling)

**Medium Priority (Phase 3-4):**
- Items 1, 2 (Architecture refactoring)
- Items 7, 8 (Advanced performance)

**Low Priority (Research):**
