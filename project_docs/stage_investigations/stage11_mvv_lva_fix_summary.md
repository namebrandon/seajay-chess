# Stage 11 MVV-LVA Fix Summary - SPRT Candidate 2

## Date: 2025-08-13
## Version: 2.11.0-mvv-lva-SPRT-candidate-2

## Problem Identified

The initial MVV-LVA implementation (SPRT candidate 1) showed a -10 ELO regression in testing. Investigation by the chess-engine-expert revealed critical performance issues:

### Root Causes
1. **Sorting ALL moves instead of just captures** - This destroyed the natural quiet move ordering from the generator (castling first, etc.)
2. **Heap allocation overhead** - Creating std::vector at every search node
3. **Double iteration** - Scoring moves, then sorting, then copying back
4. **Thread-local storage overhead** - Using static thread_local in hot path
5. **Using stable_sort unnecessarily** - When std::sort would suffice for captures

## Solution Implemented

### Key Changes

1. **In-place partition and sort**
   - Use `std::stable_partition` to separate captures from quiet moves
   - Only sort the captures portion with `std::sort`
   - Quiet moves remain in their original generator order

2. **No heap allocations**
   - All operations done in-place on the existing MoveList
   - No temporary vectors created

3. **Inline scoring**
   - MVV-LVA scores computed inline during sort comparison
   - Avoids separate scoring pass

4. **Remove thread_local**
   - Changed from `static thread_local` to local variable in negamax

5. **Optimized MVV-LVA table**
   - Simple 2D lookup table for fast scoring
   - Handles all special cases (promotions, en passant)

## Implementation Details

### Core Algorithm (move_ordering.cpp)
```cpp
void MvvLvaOrdering::orderMoves(const Board& board, MoveList& moves) const {
    if (moves.size() <= 1) return;
    
    // In-place partition: captures to front, quiet moves to back
    auto captureEnd = std::stable_partition(moves.begin(), moves.end(),
        [&board](const Move& move) {
            return isPromotion(move) || isCapture(move) || isEnPassant(move);
        });
    
    // Only sort the captures portion
    if (captureEnd != moves.begin()) {
        std::sort(moves.begin(), captureEnd,
            [&board](const Move& a, const Move& b) {
                // Inline MVV-LVA scoring
                return scoreMove(a) > scoreMove(b);
            });
    }
}
```

### Files Modified
1. `/workspace/src/search/move_ordering.cpp` - Complete rewrite for in-place sorting
2. `/workspace/src/search/negamax.cpp` - Removed thread_local keyword
3. `/workspace/src/uci/uci.cpp` - Updated version to 2.11.0-mvv-lva-SPRT-candidate-2

## Performance Improvements

### Before (Candidate 1)
- Heap allocation at every node
- O(n log n) sort of ALL moves
- Double iteration overhead
- Thread-local storage access

### After (Candidate 2)
- Zero heap allocations
- O(c log c) sort where c = number of captures (typically << n)
- Single-pass partition
- Local variable access

## Expected Impact

1. **Reduced memory pressure** - No allocations in hot path
2. **Better cache locality** - In-place operations
3. **Preserved move ordering** - Quiet moves maintain generator's good ordering
4. **Lower overhead** - Fewer operations overall

## Testing

Verified that:
- Captures are correctly sorted by MVV-LVA value
- Quiet moves preserve their original order
- No memory allocations in the ordering function
- Engine passes perft tests
- Search still functions correctly

## Next Steps

1. Run SPRT test with this candidate
2. Expected to show positive ELO gain
3. If successful, mark Stage 11 as complete

## Key Insight

MVV-LVA should ONLY reorder captures, never quiet moves. The move generator already produces quiet moves in a good order (castling first, etc.), and this natural ordering should be preserved. Sorting all moves was actively harmful to search performance.
