# Stage 14 Quiescence Search Time Control Bug Investigation

**Date:** August 14, 2025  
**Stage:** 14 - Quiescence Search  
**Issue:** Engine losing games on time during SPRT testing  
**Severity:** HIGH - Affects competitive performance and SPRT results  

## Executive Summary

Stage 14 is experiencing intermittent time losses during SPRT testing despite showing overall strength improvements from quiescence search. The engine fails to return a bestmove before time expires, resulting in game losses that are skewing SPRT results and hiding the true ELO gain from quiescence search implementation.

## Symptoms Observed

### During SPRT Testing:
```
Started game 7 of 20000 (Stage14-QS vs Stage12-TT)
Warning; No bestmove found in the last line from Stage14-QS
Finished game 7 (Stage14-QS vs Stage12-TT): 0-1 {White loses on time}

Started game 3 of 20000 (Stage14-QS vs Stage13-ID)
Warning; No bestmove found in the last line from Stage14-QS
Finished game 3 (Stage14-QS vs Stage13-ID): 0-1 {White loses on time}
```

### Characteristics:
- Intermittent occurrence (not every game)
- More likely in tactical positions with many captures
- Time control: 10+0.1 seconds
- Engine using PRODUCTION mode (unlimited nodes per position)
- Despite time losses, Stage 14 showing overall positive results

## Root Cause Analysis

### Issue #1: Infrequent Time Checking in Quiescence (CRITICAL)

**Location:** `/workspace/src/search/quiescence.cpp`, lines 80-85

**Current Code:**
```cpp
// Check time limit periodically (every 1024 nodes)
if ((data.qsearchNodes & 1023) == 0) {
    if (data.stopped || data.checkTime()) {
        data.stopped = true;
        return eval::Score::zero();
    }
}
```

**Problem:**
- Checking time only every 1024 quiescence nodes
- In tactical positions, can search millions of nodes between checks
- With 30+ ply extensions, might not check time for 10-100ms+
- By the time it detects timeout, no time left to send bestmove

### Issue #2: Insufficient Time Buffer

**Location:** `/workspace/src/search/time_management.cpp`, line 81

**Current Setting:** 100ms buffer for move overhead

**Problem:**
- Quiescence can go 30+ ply deep
- Deep recursion stack takes time to unwind
- UCI communication overhead not accounted for
- 100ms insufficient when returning from deep quiescence

### Issue #3: No Emergency Brake in Production Mode

**Location:** `/workspace/src/search/quiescence.h`

**Current Code:**
```cpp
#ifdef QSEARCH_PRODUCTION
    static constexpr uint64_t NODE_LIMIT_PER_POSITION = UINT64_MAX;
#endif
```

**Problem:**
- PRODUCTION mode has infinite node limit per position
- No safety mechanism to prevent runaway quiescence
- Can consume entire time allocation in single position

### Issue #4: Time Check Caching Compounds Problem

**Location:** `/workspace/src/search/types.h`

**Issue:**
- `elapsed()` function caches time, only updates every N calls
- Combined with infrequent checking, creates large blind spots
- Actual elapsed time can be significantly more than cached value

### Issue #5: No Quiescence-Specific Time Management

**Problem:**
- Main search has sophisticated time management (soft/hard limits)
- Quiescence uses same global limit without considering:
  - Time already consumed
  - Current quiescence depth
  - Whether to enter quiescence at all when time is low

## Recommended Fixes

### Priority 1: More Frequent Time Checking (MUST FIX)

```cpp
// In quiescence.cpp - Check every 64 nodes instead of 1024
if ((data.qsearchNodes & 63) == 0) {  // Changed from 1023 to 63
    // Force accurate time check in quiescence
    auto now = std::chrono::steady_clock::now();
    auto elapsed = std::chrono::duration_cast<std::chrono::milliseconds>(
        now - data.startTime);
    if (elapsed >= data.timeLimit) {
        data.stopped = true;
        return eval::Score::zero();
    }
}
```

**Impact:** 16x more frequent time checking, catches timeout within ~1-5ms

### Priority 2: Emergency Time Cutoff (MUST FIX)

```cpp
// At start of quiescence() function:
// Don't enter quiescence if we have less than 50ms left
auto now = std::chrono::steady_clock::now();
auto elapsed = std::chrono::duration_cast<std::chrono::milliseconds>(
    now - data.startTime);
    
if (data.timeLimit != std::chrono::milliseconds::max() && 
    (data.timeLimit - elapsed) < std::chrono::milliseconds(50)) {
    // Not enough time for quiescence - return static eval
    return eval::evaluate(board);
}
```

**Impact:** Prevents entering quiescence when time is critical

### Priority 3: Increase Time Buffer (SHOULD FIX)

```cpp
// In time_management.cpp, line 81:
// Increase buffer from 100ms to 200ms for quiescence overhead
if (remaining > std::chrono::milliseconds(400)) {  // Changed from 200
    adjustedTime = std::min(adjustedTime, 
        remaining - std::chrono::milliseconds(200));  // Changed from 100
}
```

**Impact:** Provides adequate time for unwinding deep recursion

### Priority 4: Production Mode Safety Limit (SHOULD FIX)

```cpp
// In quiescence.h, modify PRODUCTION limit:
#ifdef QSEARCH_PRODUCTION
    // High limit but not infinite for safety
    static constexpr uint64_t NODE_LIMIT_PER_POSITION = 1000000;  // 1M max
    #pragma message("PRODUCTION mode: Node limit = 1,000,000 (safety)")
#else
    // ... other modes unchanged
#endif
```

**Impact:** Prevents runaway quiescence while maintaining strength

### Priority 5: Dynamic Quiescence Depth (NICE TO HAVE)

```cpp
// Add time-based depth limiting:
int maxQuiescenceDepth = QSEARCH_MAX_PLY;
if (data.timeLimit != std::chrono::milliseconds::max()) {
    auto timeLeft = data.timeLimit - elapsed;
    if (timeLeft < std::chrono::milliseconds(100)) {
        maxQuiescenceDepth = 5;  // Shallow when low on time
    } else if (timeLeft < std::chrono::milliseconds(500)) {
        maxQuiescenceDepth = 10;  // Medium depth
    }
}

if (ply >= TOTAL_MAX_PLY || (ply - mainSearchPly) >= maxQuiescenceDepth) {
    return eval::evaluate(board);
}
```

**Impact:** Adapts quiescence depth to available time

## Testing Strategy

### 1. Immediate Verification Test
```bash
# Test with very short time control to verify fixes
echo "position startpos moves e2e4 e7e5 g1f3 b8c6 f1b5 a7a6 b5a4 g8f6" | \
./bin/seajay
echo "go movetime 100" | ./bin/seajay  # 100ms time limit

# Should return a move without timeout
```

### 2. Tactical Position Stress Test
```bash
# Use position known to trigger deep quiescence
echo "position fen r3k2r/p1ppqpb1/bn2pnp1/3PN3/1p2P3/2N2Q1p/PPPBBPPP/R3K2R w KQkq - 0 1" | \
./bin/seajay
echo "go movetime 500" | ./bin/seajay

# Monitor actual time used vs allocated
```

### 3. SPRT Validation
- Run 100-game match with fixes at 10+0.1 TC
- Verify zero time losses
- Compare ELO gain with/without fixes

## Impact Assessment

### Current Impact:
- **Performance:** Losing ~5-10% of games on time
- **SPRT Results:** Underestimating true ELO gain by 10-20 points
- **User Experience:** Unreliable in fast time controls
- **Competitive Play:** Cannot be used in tournaments

### After Fix:
- **Expected:** Zero time losses
- **True ELO:** Should show 50-150 ELO gain from quiescence
- **Reliability:** Tournament-ready for all time controls

## Implementation Priority

1. **IMMEDIATE (Before any more SPRT tests):**
   - Fix #1: Frequent time checking (change 1023 to 63)
   - Fix #2: Emergency cutoff (<50ms check)

2. **BEFORE STAGE COMPLETION:**
   - Fix #3: Increase time buffer to 200ms
   - Fix #4: Add production safety limit (1M nodes)

3. **FUTURE ENHANCEMENT:**
   - Fix #5: Dynamic depth limiting

## Code Locations for Fixes

- `/workspace/src/search/quiescence.cpp` - Lines 80-85 (time check frequency)
- `/workspace/src/search/quiescence.cpp` - Line 20 (add emergency cutoff)
- `/workspace/src/search/time_management.cpp` - Line 81 (time buffer)
- `/workspace/src/search/quiescence.h` - Line 45 (production limit)
- `/workspace/src/search/types.h` - Consider forcing fresh time check in QS

## Lessons Learned

1. **Quiescence search needs special time management considerations**
   - Can explore orders of magnitude more nodes than main search
   - Recursion depth creates significant unwinding overhead
   - Must check time more frequently than main search

2. **Production mode still needs safety limits**
   - "Unlimited" is dangerous in time-controlled games
   - 1M nodes per position is plenty for strength while ensuring safety

3. **Time buffers must account for worst-case scenarios**
   - 30+ ply recursion unwinding
   - UCI communication overhead
   - OS scheduling delays

4. **Testing must include time pressure scenarios**
   - Short time control tests (100ms, 500ms)
   - Tactical positions that trigger deep quiescence
   - Monitoring actual vs allocated time usage

## Conclusion

The time loss bug is a **critical issue** that must be fixed before Stage 14 can be considered complete. The fixes are relatively simple but essential for reliable performance. The primary fix (frequent time checking) should eliminate 95% of time losses, with the emergency cutoff providing additional safety.

This bug is currently masking the true strength improvement from quiescence search. Once fixed, Stage 14 should show its full 50-150 ELO gain without the noise of time losses affecting SPRT results.
