# Stage 9b SPRT Testing - Draw Detection Validation

## Overview

This SPRT test validates Stage 9b draw detection implementation against Stage 9 baseline. **This is NOT a traditional Elo improvement test** - it focuses on draw rate reduction and correctness.

## Success Criteria

### Primary Goals
- **Draw Rate Reduction**: Stage 9b < 35% total draws (vs >40% for Stage 9)
- **Repetition Elimination**: Stage 9b < 10% repetition draws (vs >20% for Stage 9)
- **Elo Maintenance**: Within ±10 Elo (no significant regression)

### Secondary Goals
- Shorter games in drawn positions
- Proper draw detection in all cases
- No crashes or UCI issues

## Quick Start

1. **Prepare binaries**: `./prepare_stage9b_binaries.sh`
2. **Validate setup**: `./validate_sprt_setup.sh`
3. **Run SPRT test**: `./run_stage9b_sprt.sh`
4. **Analyze results**: `python3 analyze_stage9b_draws.py sprt_results/SPRT-2025-008-STAGE9B`

## Test Configuration

- **Test ID**: SPRT-2025-008-STAGE9B
- **Base Engine**: Stage 9 (no draw detection)
- **Test Engine**: Stage 9b (with draw detection)
- **SPRT Bounds**: [-10, +10] Elo (allows small regression)
- **Time Control**: 10+0.1 seconds
- **Max Games**: 2000 (may stop early)
- **Expected Duration**: 2-4 hours

## Understanding Results

### SPRT Interpretation
- **H1 accepted**: No significant regression, Stage 9b validated ✅
- **H0 accepted**: Significant regression detected ❌
- **Inconclusive**: Borderline result, manual analysis needed

### Draw Analysis Key Metrics
1. **Total Draw Rate**: Stage 9b should be significantly lower
2. **Repetition Draws**: Stage 9b should eliminate most/all repetitions
3. **Game Length**: Drawn positions should end faster with Stage 9b
4. **Elo Impact**: Should be minimal (within ±10 points)

## Files Created

- `prepare_stage9b_binaries.sh` - Creates test binaries from git commits
- `validate_sprt_setup.sh` - Verifies prerequisites
- `run_stage9b_sprt.sh` - Main SPRT test execution
- `analyze_stage9b_draws.py` - Post-test draw analysis
- Binary outputs: 
  - `/workspace/bin/seajay_stage9_base`
  - `/workspace/bin/seajay_stage9b_draws`

## Results Location

All results saved to: `/workspace/sprt_results/SPRT-2025-008-STAGE9B/`
- `console_output.txt` - Complete test output
- `games.pgn` - All game records
- `fastchess.log` - Detailed execution log

## Expected Behavior Differences

### Stage 9 (Base)
- Plays forever in drawn positions
- No repetition detection (continues after 3-fold)
- No fifty-move rule enforcement
- High draw rates from repetition/stalemate

### Stage 9b (Test)  
- Recognizes draws immediately
- Stops at exact 3-fold repetition
- Enforces fifty-move rule at 100 halfmoves
- Significantly lower draw rates

## Troubleshooting

### Common Issues
1. **Binaries not found**: Run `./prepare_stage9b_binaries.sh`
2. **Fast-chess missing**: Run `./tools/scripts/setup-external-tools.sh`
3. **UCI timeouts**: Check binary compatibility with `./validate_sprt_setup.sh`
4. **High draw rates**: Normal for Stage 9, should improve with Stage 9b

### Performance Notes
- Test may take 2-4 hours depending on hardware
- Can be stopped early with Ctrl+C (partial results saved)
- Monitor console output for progress updates

## Post-Test Analysis

After completion, run:
```bash
python3 analyze_stage9b_draws.py sprt_results/SPRT-2025-008-STAGE9B
```

This provides detailed breakdown of:
- Draw rates by engine
- Draw type classification (repetition, fifty-move, etc.)
- Success/failure assessment
- Recommendations

## Following SeaJay Process

This test follows the documented SPRT Testing Process:
1. ✅ Uses git commits for binary creation
2. ✅ Proper version naming and tracking  
3. ✅ Complete result documentation
4. ✅ Statistical significance testing
5. ✅ Post-test analysis and archival

Success here validates Stage 9b for integration into main development branch.
