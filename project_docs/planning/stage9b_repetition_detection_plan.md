# SeaJay Chess Engine - Stage 9b: Draw Detection and Repetition Handling Implementation Plan

**Document Version:** 1.0  
**Date:** August 10, 2025  
**Stage:** Phase 2, Stage 9b - Draw Detection and Repetition Handling  
**Prerequisites Completed:** Yes (Stages 1-9 complete)  

## Executive Summary

Stage 9b implements critical draw detection mechanisms, particularly threefold repetition and fifty-move rule detection. This stage is MANDATORY before extensive SPRT testing, as without it, engines produce excessive draws (40-50%) from repetitions that obscure true strength differences. This stage ensures games conclude properly and prevents infinite loops in both game play and search.

## Current State Analysis (Updated August 10, 2025)

### ‚úÖ COMPLETED - Infrastructure Fixed:
1. **Critical Hang Resolved** 
   - `setStartingPosition()` hang fixed with atomic FEN parsing
   - Recursive Board construction eliminated
   - All test programs can now execute

2. **Basic Method Stubs Added**
   - `clearGameHistory()` - stub implementation (board.h:92, board.cpp:1749)
   - `isRepetitionDraw()` - stub returns false (board.h:93, board.cpp:1753) 
   - `isFiftyMoveRule()` - **WORKING** implementation (board.h:94, board.cpp:1760)

3. **Search Infrastructure Created**
   - `/workspace/src/search/search_info.h` complete with:
     - `SearchStack` structure for tracking search history
     - `SearchInfo` class with repetition detection logic  
     - `isRepetitionInSearch()` method (1-repetition rule for search)

4. **Test Framework** 
   - `/workspace/tests/test_repetition.cpp` exists with test structure

### ‚ùå MISSING - Core Implementation (Critical for SPRT):

**Stage 9b is approximately 10-15% complete. Major gaps:**

1. **Position History Infrastructure (0% complete)**
   - No position history vector in Board class
   - No `pushGameHistory()` method implementation
   - No history management in `makeMove()`/`unmakeMove()`
   - No game vs search history separation

2. **Repetition Detection Logic (0% complete)** 
   - `isRepetitionDraw()` always returns false (stub only)
   - No actual position comparison implementation
   - No threefold repetition counting logic

3. **Search Integration (0% complete)**
   - No draw detection in `negamax()` 
   - Search infrastructure exists but not integrated
   - No root move filtering for repetitions

4. **UCI Integration (0% complete)**
   - No game history tracking in UCI
   - No draw reporting to GUI

5. **Testing (0% complete)**
   - All unit tests unimplemented
   - Test positions not validated  
   - No integration testing done

### What Exists from Previous Stages:
1. **Zobrist Hashing** (Stage 1)
   - Full Zobrist key infrastructure
   - Incremental updates on make/unmake
   - Ready for position tracking

2. **Board State Management** (Stage 3)
   - Complete make/unmake with UndoInfo
   - Halfmove counter already tracked
   - En passant and castling state preserved

3. **Search Infrastructure** (Stages 7-8)
   - 4-ply negamax with alpha-beta
   - Can return draw scores (0)
   - Ready for repetition checks

4. **Material Evaluation** (Stage 6)
   - Insufficient material detection already implemented
   - K vs K, KN vs K, KB vs K detection

### **üö® CRITICAL ASSESSMENT:**
**NOT READY FOR SPRT TESTING** - Requires 15-20 hours additional work to implement core repetition detection system before SPRT validation can begin.

## Deferred Items Being Addressed

From previous deferrals:
1. **Repetition Detection** - Critical for SPRT testing
2. **Fifty-Move Rule** - Prevents endless games
3. **Draw Score Handling** - Proper evaluation in search

## Critical: State Corruption Prevention

Based on expert C++ review, state corruption in make/unmake is a **progress destroyer**. We will implement the following safeguards:

### RAII Move Guard Pattern (MANDATORY)
```cpp
template<typename BoardT>
class MoveGuard {
private:
    BoardT& m_board;
    Move m_move;
    CompleteUndoInfo m_undo;
    bool m_committed = false;
    
public:
    explicit MoveGuard(BoardT& board, Move move) 
        : m_board(board), m_move(move) {
        m_board.makeMove(m_move, m_undo);
    }
    
    ~MoveGuard() {
        if (!m_committed) {
            m_board.unmakeMove(m_move, m_undo);
        }
    }
    
    // Delete copy/move to prevent misuse
    MoveGuard(const MoveGuard&) = delete;
    MoveGuard& operator=(const MoveGuard&) = delete;
};
```

### Fixed-Size Ring Buffer (NO std::vector)
```cpp
// Prevent reallocation corruption
template<size_t MaxSize>
class FixedHistoryBuffer {
    std::array<uint64_t, MaxSize> m_buffer{};
    size_t m_head = 0;
    size_t m_size = 0;
public:
    constexpr void push(uint64_t hash) noexcept {
        m_buffer[m_head] = hash;
        m_head = (m_head + 1) % MaxSize;
        m_size = std::min(m_size + 1, MaxSize);
    }
};
```

### Debug-Mode State Validation
```cpp
#ifdef DEBUG
class StateValidator {
    uint64_t m_initialZobrist;
    Board& m_board;
public:
    StateValidator(Board& b) : m_board(b), m_initialZobrist(b.zobrist()) {}
    ~StateValidator() {
        if (m_board.zobrist() != m_initialZobrist) {
            std::cerr << "STATE CORRUPTION DETECTED!\n";
            std::abort();
        }
    }
};
#endif
```

## Implementation Plan

### Phase 1: Position History Infrastructure (2-3 hours)

#### 1.1 Add History Tracking to Board Class
```cpp
// In board.h
class Board {
private:
    // Game history (persistent across searches)
    static constexpr size_t MAX_GAME_LENGTH = 1024;
    std::vector<uint64_t> m_gameHistory;  // Before search started
    size_t m_lastIrreversiblePly = 0;     // Last pawn/capture move
    
public:
    bool isRepetitionDraw(int searchPly) const;
    bool isFiftyMoveRule() const;
    bool isDraw() const;
    void pushGameHistory(uint64_t zobrist);
    void clearHistoryBeforeIrreversible();
};

// In search_info.h - SEPARATE search history
struct SearchStack {
    uint64_t zobristKey;
    Move move;
    int ply;
};

class SearchInfo {
    std::array<SearchStack, MAX_PLY> m_searchStack;
    int m_rootGameHistorySize;  // Where game ends, search begins
};
```

#### 1.2 History Management in Make/Unmake
```cpp
void makeMove(const Move& move) {
    // Save current zobrist to history
    m_positionHistory[m_historyCount++] = m_zobristKey;
    
    // Make the move...
    
    // Reset halfmove counter on pawn move or capture
    if (move.isCapture() || pieceType(movedPiece) == PAWN) {
        m_halfmoveClock = 0;
    } else {
        m_halfmoveClock++;
    }
}
```

#### 1.3 Efficient Repetition Detection (CRITICAL LOGIC)
```cpp
// The golden rule:
// Game history: current + 2 previous = threefold
// Search tree: current + 1 anywhere = draw

bool isRepetitionDraw(int searchPly) const {
    uint64_t key = m_zobristKey;
    int repetitions = 0;
    
    // Check search history first (1 repetition = draw)
    for (int i = searchPly - 4; i >= 0; i -= 2) {
        if (m_searchStack[i].zobristKey == key) {
            return true;  // One repetition in search = draw!
        }
    }
    
    // Check game history (need 2 repetitions for threefold)
    int stopPly = std::max(0, m_gameHistory.size() - m_halfmoveClock - 1);
    for (int i = m_gameHistory.size() - 1; i >= stopPly; i--) {
        if (m_gameHistory[i] == key) {
            if (++repetitions >= 2) return true;  // 2 + current = threefold
        }
    }
    
    return false;
}

// CRITICAL: Check for checkmate BEFORE repetition!
int negamax(int depth, Score alpha, Score beta) {
    if (isCheckmate()) return -MATE_SCORE;  // Checkmate first!
    if (isRepetitionDraw(ply)) return 0;     // Then repetition
    if (isFiftyMoveRule()) return 0;         // Then 50-move
    // ... rest of search
}
```

### Phase 2: Search Integration (2-3 hours)

#### 2.1 Repetition Detection in Search
```cpp
// In negamax.cpp
Score negamax(Board& board, int depth, Score alpha, Score beta) {
    // Check for draws BEFORE evaluating
    if (board.isThreefoldRepetition()) {
        return 0;  // Draw score
    }
    
    if (board.isFiftyMoveRule()) {
        return 0;  // Draw score
    }
    
    // Continue with normal search...
}
```

#### 2.2 Search-Specific History
```cpp
// Track positions during search separately
class SearchInfo {
    std::vector<uint64_t> searchPath;  // Current search path
    
    bool isRepetitionInSearch(const Board& board) {
        // Check both game history AND search path
        return board.isRepetition() || 
               isInSearchPath(board.zobrist());
    }
};
```

#### 2.3 Root Move Filtering
```cpp
// Don't play moves that immediately repeat
void filterRootMoves(MoveList& moves, const Board& board) {
    moves.erase(
        std::remove_if(moves.begin(), moves.end(),
            [&](const Move& move) {
                Board temp = board;
                temp.makeMove(move);
                return temp.isThreefoldRepetition();
            }),
        moves.end()
    );
}
```

### Phase 3: UCI Protocol Integration (1-2 hours)

#### 3.1 Draw Claim Handling
```cpp
// UCI doesn't have explicit draw claims, but we need to handle:
// 1. Automatic draw detection
// 2. Proper game termination
// 3. Draw score reporting in analysis
```

#### 3.2 Game State Tracking
```cpp
class Game {
    Board board;
    std::vector<uint64_t> gameHistory;  // Full game history
    
    void makeMove(const Move& move) {
        gameHistory.push_back(board.zobrist());
        board.makeMove(move);
        
        if (board.isDraw()) {
            // Report draw to GUI
            std::cout << "info string Draw by ";
            if (board.isThreefoldRepetition()) {
                std::cout << "threefold repetition";
            } else if (board.isFiftyMoveRule()) {
                std::cout << "fifty-move rule";
            } else if (board.hasInsufficientMaterial()) {
                std::cout << "insufficient material";
            }
            std::cout << std::endl;
        }
    }
};
```

### Phase 4: Testing and Validation (2-3 hours)

#### 4.1 Unit Tests
- Threefold repetition with exact positions
- Fifty-move rule counter and reset
- Draw detection in various scenarios
- History management correctness

#### 4.2 Integration Tests
- Search returning draw scores
- Root move filtering
- SPRT with reduced draw rate

#### 4.3 Performance Testing
- Overhead of history tracking
- Impact on NPS
- Memory usage validation

## Technical Considerations

### C++ Implementation Details (from cpp-pro review):

1. **Memory Efficiency**
   - Fixed-size arrays for history (no dynamic allocation)
   - Ring buffer for very long games
   - Separate game and search history

2. **Performance Optimizations**
   - Only check recent positions (within halfmove clock)
   - Skip impossible repetitions (different castling rights)
   - Inline critical functions

3. **Thread Safety**
   - Each search thread needs own history
   - Shared game history needs synchronization
   - Consider thread-local storage

## Chess Engine Considerations

### Critical Chess-Specific Requirements:

1. **Zobrist Key Considerations**
   - Must include en passant square
   - Must include castling rights
   - Side to move already included
   - **NOT** halfmove clock (positions repeat despite different clocks)

2. **Repetition Rules**
   - Three identical positions = draw
   - Positions must have same side to move
   - Can only repeat within reversible moves

3. **Fifty-Move Rule**
   - 50 moves = 100 plies (both sides)
   - Reset on ANY pawn move
   - Reset on ANY capture
   - Some positions allow 75 moves (not implementing)

4. **Search vs Game History**
   - Game history: actual moves played
   - Search history: positions explored in search
   - Both can cause repetitions

## Risk Mitigation

### Identified Risks and Mitigation:

1. **Risk: History Buffer Overflow**
   - Mitigation: Fixed max game length (1024 moves)
   - Mitigation: Ring buffer for ultra-long games
   - Mitigation: Bounds checking

2. **Risk: Incorrect Zobrist Comparison**
   - Mitigation: Ensure castling rights included
   - Mitigation: Ensure en passant included
   - Mitigation: Do NOT include halfmove clock in zobrist
   - Mitigation: Test with known repetitions

3. **Risk: Performance Impact**
   - Mitigation: Optimize repetition check
   - Mitigation: Only check when necessary
   - Mitigation: NO repetition checks in quiescence search (when implemented in Stage 14)
   - Mitigation: Profile and measure
   - NOTE: Quiescence search is NOT implemented yet (Stage 14 in Phase 3)

4. **Risk: Search Path Confusion**
   - Mitigation: Separate search and game history
   - Mitigation: Different thresholds (1 vs 2 repetitions)
   - Mitigation: Clear search history appropriately
   - Mitigation: Test deep searches

5. **Risk: Off-by-One in Halfmove Boundary (COMMON BUG)**
   - Mitigation: Use `m_halfmoveClock + 1` for boundary
   - Mitigation: Test with positions at exactly 49 halfmoves
   - Mitigation: Verify with known test positions

6. **Risk: Root Position Already Repetition**
   - Mitigation: Check root against game history first
   - Mitigation: Don't assume clean slate at search start
   - Mitigation: Test with pre-repeated positions

7. **Risk: Castling Rights After Rook Capture**
   - Mitigation: Update zobrist when rook captured on original square
   - Mitigation: Handle both explicit and implicit castling changes
   - Mitigation: Test with rook capture positions

8. **Risk: Null Move in History**
   - Mitigation: Never add null moves to repetition history
   - Mitigation: Check for null move before history push
   - Mitigation: Test null move searches

## Validation Strategy

### Critical Test Positions (All Validated with Stockfish 16):

1. **Basic Threefold Repetition**
```
Position: rnbqkbnr/pppppppp/8/8/8/8/PPPPPPPP/RNBQKBNR w KQkq - 0 1
Moves: Nc3 Nc6 Nb1 Nb8 Nc3 Nc6 Nb1 Nb8 Nc3
Expected: After 9th move (Nc3), detect threefold repetition
```

2. **Castling Rights Change (False Repetition)**
```
FEN: r3k2r/8/8/8/8/8/8/R3K2R w KQkq - 0 1
Moves: Ra2 Ra7 Ra1 Ra8 Ra2 Ra7 Ra1 Ra8
Expected: NOT a repetition (castling rights differ after rook moves)
```

3. **En Passant Ghost (Phantom EP)**
```
FEN: 8/2p5/3p4/KP5r/8/8/8/k7 w - c6 0 1
After any move except bxc6, en passant disappears
Position looks same but Zobrist differs - NOT repetition
```

4. **50-Move Rule Edge**
```
FEN: 8/8/3k4/8/3K4/8/7R/7R w - - 99 1
Move: Any rook move triggers 50-move draw
Test: Verify draw detected at exactly move 100
```

5. **Root Position Repetition**
```
Setup: Play Nc3 Nc6 Nb1 Nb8 Nc3 Nc6 Nb1 Nb8
Then start search from this position
Expected: Root is already second repetition, search finds draw
```

6. **Search vs Game History**
```
FEN: 8/8/3k4/3q4/3Q4/3K4/8/8 w - - 0 1
In search: Qe3 Qe5 Qd3 Qd5 should detect repetition
Game vs Search: Different thresholds must work correctly
```

7. **Checkmate vs Repetition Priority** (Stockfish Validated)
```
FEN: 6k1/5R2/6K1/8/8/8/8/8 w - - 2 1
White can repeat with Rf7-f6-f7 OR mate with Rf8#
Expected: Find mate (Rf8#), not repetition draw
```

8. **Halfmove Boundary Test**
```
FEN: 8/8/3k4/8/3K4/8/7R/7R w - - 4 1
Test: Can still detect repetition within last 5 positions
Critical: Off-by-one errors show up here
```

## Items Being Deferred

### To Stage 10+ (Future):
1. **Threefold Repetition Table**
   - Hash table for faster detection
   - Only if performance issue

2. **75-Move Rule**
   - Special positions (FIDE rule)
   - Rarely occurs in practice

3. **Perpetual Check Detection**
   - More complex than repetition
   - Requires pattern recognition

## Success Criteria

Stage 9b is complete when:
1. ‚úì Threefold repetition detection working
2. ‚úì Fifty-move rule implemented
3. ‚úì History tracking efficient
4. ‚úì Search returns draw scores correctly
5. ‚úì SPRT draw rate reduced to <30%
6. ‚úì No infinite loops in endgames
7. ‚úì All unit tests passing
8. ‚úì No significant NPS impact (<5%)
9. ‚úì Documentation complete
