### 8:01 PM - Project Genesis

Dear Diary,

Today marks the birth of SeaJay! After months of dreaming about building a chess engine that could reach master strength, I finally took the plunge. The initial commit laid down the foundation - project structure, CMake configuration, development container setup. It feels like standing at the base of a mountain, looking up at the summit. The goal is ambitious: 3200+ Elo strength through NNUE evaluation. But every great engine started with a single commit, right?

The name "SeaJay" has a nice ring to it. Set up the project with a phased development approach - seven phases total, starting with the fundamentals and building up to custom NNUE training. The Master Project Plan is comprehensive, maybe even overwhelming, but having a roadmap gives me confidence.

### 8:18 PM - Adding Character

Added the SeaJay logo to the project. Every engine needs an identity! It's the small touches that make a project feel real.

### 8:30 PM - Stage 1 Begins

Started implementing Phase 1, Stage 1 - Board Representation. The hybrid bitboard-mailbox approach seems like the right choice. Bitboards for fast parallel operations, mailbox for quick piece lookup. Best of both worlds.

Created the basic types first - `Square`, `Piece`, `Color`. These fundamentals are crucial to get right. Spent time thinking about the representation: should pieces be 0-11 or should I separate piece type and color? Went with the combined approach for cache efficiency.

### 9:00 PM - The Great FEN Debugging Saga

Oh, the hubris of thinking FEN parsing would be straightforward! Implemented the board representation with what I thought was a solid FEN parser. The initial tests passed, but then... disaster. The board display function sent the program into an infinite loop. 

The bug was subtle but devastating: in the rank loop, I had written `for (Rank r = 7; r <= 7; --r)`. Since `r` is unsigned, when it decrements from 0, it wraps around to 255, and the loop never ends. Such a classic C++ footgun!

But that wasn't the only issue. The C++ expert agent caught multiple problems:
- Iterator type mismatch in the FEN parser (using int for Piece enum)
- Missing bounds checking that could cause buffer overruns
- Zobrist key calculation errors in the move function

### 9:13 PM - Victory Through Validation

After fixing the bugs, I realized we needed bulletproof FEN validation. Too many chess engines have fallen into the trap of assuming FEN conversion is correct, only to spend hours debugging mysterious position corruptions.

Implemented comprehensive FEN validation with 99 test cases covering:
- Piece count validation (max 8 pawns, 1 king per side, etc.)
- Illegal positions (pawns on back ranks, adjacent kings)
- En passant square validation
- Castling rights consistency checks
- Perfect round-trip testing (FEN → Board → FEN)

The test suite caught several edge cases I hadn't considered. For example, what if someone provides a FEN with 9 white queens? Or pawns on the first rank? Now these are all properly rejected.

### 9:30 PM - Sliding Piece Attacks

Almost forgot a key Stage 1 requirement - basic ray-based sliding piece move generation! This is just a temporary implementation (will be replaced with magic bitboards in Phase 3), but it's needed for the foundation.

Implemented simple ray-casting for rooks, bishops, and queens. The algorithm walks along each ray direction until it hits a piece or the board edge. Not the fastest approach, but clean and correct. The magic bitboard implementation will give us a 3-5x speedup later.

### 9:45 PM - Stage 1 Complete!

All tests passing! 
- ✅ Board representation working perfectly
- ✅ FEN parsing bulletproof with 99 test cases
- ✅ Bitboard operations validated
- ✅ Zobrist hashing infrastructure ready
- ✅ Ray-based sliding attacks implemented
- ✅ Comprehensive unit tests passing

Committed everything with a proper commit message and co-author attribution to Claude. It's important to document the AI collaboration transparently.

**Final Statistics for Stage 1:**
- Lines of code: ~450 (core) + ~200 (tests)
- Test cases: 99 (FEN) + 8 (board operations)
- Bugs fixed: 4 critical, 2 minor
- Coffee consumed: 3 cups
- Satisfaction level: Maximum!

### Reflections

Today reminded me why I love low-level programming despite its challenges. That infinite loop bug could have been prevented with better attention to unsigned arithmetic. The lesson: always be paranoid about loop conditions with unsigned types.

The collaboration with Claude as a pair programmer is fascinating. Having an AI catch bugs, suggest improvements, and implement comprehensive tests feels like having a senior developer looking over my shoulder. The key is being specific about requirements and accepting that even AI-generated code needs careful review.

Tomorrow we move on to Stage 2 - Position Management. But tonight, I celebrate. Stage 1 is rock solid, and SeaJay has taken its first breath.

The journey to 3200 Elo begins with a single board representation. And ours is bulletproof.
