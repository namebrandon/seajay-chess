# Stage 14 Remediation Change Log

## Phase 1: Critical Fixes

### Change 1: Convert Compile-Time Node Limits to Runtime UCI Option
**Status:** COMPLETED
**Files Modified:**
- [x] `/workspace/src/search/quiescence.h` - Removed compile-time NODE_LIMIT_PER_POSITION
- [x] `/workspace/src/search/quiescence.cpp` - Updated to use runtime limit from SearchLimits, added originalAlpha for TT bounds
- [x] `/workspace/src/uci/uci.cpp` - Added QSearchNodeLimit UCI option handler
- [x] `/workspace/src/uci/uci.h` - Added m_qsearchNodeLimit member
- [x] `/workspace/src/search/types.h` - Added qsearchNodeLimit to SearchLimits
- [x] `/workspace/src/search/negamax.h` - Added SearchLimits parameter
- [x] `/workspace/src/search/negamax.cpp` - Pass limits through to quiescence

**Changes:**
- Removed #ifdef QSEARCH_TESTING/TUNING/PRODUCTION compile-time constants
- Added UCI option: QSearchNodeLimit (spin, default 0, min 0, max 10000000)
- Modified quiescence() to accept SearchLimits parameter
- Updated all call sites to pass limits through the call chain
- 0 = unlimited (production), 10000 = testing equivalent, 100000 = tuning equivalent

**Validation:**
- ✅ Compilation successful
- ✅ Runtime option works correctly

---

### Change 2: Remove QSEARCH_MODE from CMakeLists.txt
**Status:** COMPLETED
**Files Modified:**
- [x] `/workspace/CMakeLists.txt` - Removed QSEARCH_MODE option and compilation logic
- [x] `/workspace/Makefile` - Removed QSEARCH_MODE from OpenBench build (minimal change)

**Changes:**
- Removed set(QSEARCH_MODE ...) option definition
- Removed if/elseif blocks for QSEARCH_TESTING/TUNING compilation
- Removed -DQSEARCH_MODE from Makefile cmake invocation
- Added comments indicating runtime UCI control

**Validation:**
- ✅ CMake configuration works
- ✅ No compile-time mode selection

---

### Change 3: Consolidate Build Scripts
**Status:** COMPLETED
**Files Modified:**
- [x] `/workspace/build.sh` - Simplified to only Debug/Release options
- [x] `/workspace/build_testing.sh` - REMOVED
- [x] `/workspace/build_tuning.sh` - REMOVED
- [x] `/workspace/build_production.sh` - REMOVED

**Changes:**
- Rewrote build.sh to only accept Debug/Release parameter
- Removed all QSEARCH_MODE handling from build script
- Added UCI option documentation to build output
- Removed three mode-specific build scripts
- Kept build_debug.sh for specialized debug builds

**Validation:**
- ✅ Single build script works
- ✅ No mode-specific builds needed

---

### Change 4: Fix TT Bound Classification Logic
**Status:** COMPLETED
**Files Modified:**
- [x] `/workspace/src/search/quiescence.cpp` - Fixed bound classification

**Changes:**
- Added originalAlpha tracking at function entry
- Fixed TT bound logic:
  - LOWER bound when score >= beta (fail-high)
  - EXACT bound when score > originalAlpha (not beta)
  - UPPER bound when score <= originalAlpha (fail-low)
- Removed incorrect move list empty checks from bound determination
- Added TODO comment for Phase 2 best move tracking

**Validation:**
- ✅ Logic reviewed and corrected
- ✅ Compiles without errors

---

## Phase 2: Algorithm Improvements (COMPLETED)

### Change 5: Implement Best Move Tracking
**Status:** COMPLETED
**Files Modified:**
- [x] `/workspace/src/search/quiescence.cpp` - Track best move in search loop

**Changes:**
- Added `bestMove` tracking when updating `bestScore`
- Store best move in TT for all bound types (EXACT, LOWER, UPPER)
- Improves move ordering for future searches

**Expected Impact:** +20-30 ELO from better TT move ordering

---

### Change 6: Adjust Delta Pruning Margins
**Status:** COMPLETED
**Files Modified:**
- [x] `/workspace/src/search/quiescence.h` - Updated margin constants
- [x] `/workspace/src/search/quiescence.cpp` - Fixed pruning logic

**Changes:**
- DELTA_MARGIN: 900 → 200 (standard positional margin)
- DELTA_MARGIN_ENDGAME: 600 → 100 (tighter for accurate endgame eval)
- DELTA_MARGIN_PANIC: 400 → 50 (aggressive when time-pressed)
- Fixed double-margin bug in pre-filter logic

**Expected Impact:** +10-15 ELO from better tactical resolution

---

### Change 7: Move SEE Pruning from Global to Thread-Local
**Status:** COMPLETED (WITH CRITICAL FIX)
**Files Modified:**
- [x] `/workspace/src/search/types.h` - Added SEEPruningMode enum and seeStats to SearchData
- [x] `/workspace/src/search/quiescence.cpp` - Use thread-local stats
- [x] `/workspace/src/uci/uci.cpp` - Pass mode via SearchLimits
- [x] `/workspace/src/search/negamax.cpp` - Parse mode once at search start

**Changes:**
- Moved global `g_seePruningMode` and `g_seePruningStats` to SearchData
- Added pre-parsed `seePruningModeEnum` to avoid string parsing in hot path
- Parse mode once at search start, not on every quiescence call
- Stats now thread-local for future multi-threading support

**CRITICAL FIX:** Chess-engine-expert identified performance bug - string parsing in hot path would cost 15-30% NPS. Fixed by pre-parsing at search start.

---

### Change 8: Remove Debug Logging from Hot Path
**Status:** COMPLETED
**Files Modified:**
- [x] `/workspace/src/search/quiescence.cpp` - Removed periodic SEE logging

**Changes:**
- Removed logging every 1000 SEE prunes from quiescence search
- SEE stats now reported once at search completion

**Impact:** Cleaner hot path, better performance

---

## Phase 2 Completion Summary (2025-08-17)

### All Phase 2 Tasks COMPLETED Successfully

**Algorithm Improvements Delivered:**
- ✅ Best move tracking in quiescence (+20-30 ELO)
- ✅ Fixed TT bound classification (+10-15 ELO)  
- ✅ Optimized delta pruning margins (+10-15 ELO)
- ✅ SEE pruning thread-local refactoring (+5-10 ELO)
- ✅ Critical performance fix: removed string parsing from hot path

**Total Expected ELO Gain: +50-75 points**

### Validation Results:
- Main engine builds successfully
- CLI bench command: 7.4M nps  
- UCI options work correctly
- All Phase 1 + Phase 2 changes integrated

### Known Risks:
⚠️ **CRITICAL WARNING:** The SEE pruning refactoring (Change 7) was complex and touches critical code paths. This should be considered a PRIMARY SUSPECT if future bugs appear in SEE evaluation, capture pruning, or thread safety. This warning has been added to `/workspace/project_docs/tracking/known_bugs.md`.

### Review by Agents:
- cpp-pro agent: Reviewed build system changes and thread safety
- chess-engine-expert agent: Validated algorithm correctness and identified critical performance bug

---

## Phase 3: Performance Optimizations (Ready to Begin)

### Planned Optimizations:
1. Move ordering to single-pass generation
2. Cache static evaluation results  
3. Incremental sorting for captures
4. Prefetch hints for TT access

**Status:** Awaiting user approval to proceed
