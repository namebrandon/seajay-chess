# SeaJay Chess Engine - Integration Branches Tracker

**Purpose:** Track features that have unmet dependencies and require integration work  
**Last Updated:** August 20, 2025  

## Overview

Integration branches are used when a feature is discovered to have unmet dependencies during implementation. These are long-lived branches that preserve work while prerequisites are built on main, then integrated when ready.

## Active Integration Branches

### integration/lmr-with-move-ordering

**Created:** August 20, 2025  
**Source Branch:** feature/20250819-lmr  
**Status:** PENDING - Awaiting move ordering prerequisites  
**Priority:** HIGH - Core Phase 3 optimization  

#### What's Implemented:
- ✅ LMR UCI options (LMREnabled, LMRMinDepth, LMRMinMoveNumber, LMRBaseReduction, LMRDepthFactor)
- ✅ LMR reduction formula with unit tests
- ✅ Integration into negamax search loop
- ✅ LMR statistics tracking (totalReductions, reSearches, successfulReductions)
- ✅ Re-search condition bug fix (proper null window handling)
- ✅ Conservative parameters (disabled by default, minMoveNumber=8)

#### What Works:
- LMR successfully reduces nodes by 91% when enabled
- Formula correctly calculates reductions based on depth and move number
- Re-search logic properly handles null window results
- Statistics tracking shows LMR is functioning

#### Critical Issues Resolved:
1. **Re-search Condition Bug (FIXED):**
   - Was: `if (score > alpha)` 
   - Now: `if (score > alpha && score < beta)`
   - Properly handles null window search results

2. **Integer Division Bug (FIXED):**
   - Was: depthFactor=100 causing (6-3)/100=0 (no reduction)
   - Now: depthFactor=3 causing (6-3)/3=1 (proper reduction)

3. **Disabled by Default (CONFIGURED):**
   - LMREnabled defaults to false
   - Safe to merge to main without affecting gameplay

#### Unmet Dependencies:

**1. History Heuristic (CRITICAL)**
- **Issue:** Quiet moves have NO ordering (score=0 in move ordering)
- **Impact:** LMR reduces essentially random quiet moves
- **Required:** Implement history tables to track successful quiet moves
- **Implementation:** Track moves that cause beta cutoffs, score quiet moves by history
- **Expected Benefit:** Good quiet moves ordered early, LMR reduces truly bad moves
- **Stage:** Should be Stage 18 (was deferred to Stage 23)

**2. Killer Move Heuristic (HIGH)**
- **Issue:** No per-ply move ordering for quiet moves
- **Impact:** Good tactical quiet moves may be reduced inappropriately
- **Required:** Track 2 moves per ply that caused beta cutoffs
- **Implementation:** Simple killer[ply][0] and killer[ply][1] storage
- **Expected Benefit:** Tactical quiet moves ordered before LMR consideration
- **Stage:** Should be Stage 19 (was deferred to Stage 22)

#### Current Performance:
- **LMREnabled=true:** -11.62 ± 10.36 ELO (✅ TESTED - loses ELO without move ordering)
- **LMREnabled=false:** -0.97 ± 5.52 ELO (✅ TESTED - clean baseline)
- **Expected With Dependencies:** +50-100 ELO (standard LMR benefit)
- **Node Reduction:** Expected 60-80% with conservative parameters
- **Test Results:** https://openbench.seajay-chess.dev/test/16/ (LMR=true), https://openbench.seajay-chess.dev/test/17/ (baseline)

#### Testing Strategy:
1. **Phase 1 (✅ COMPLETE):** Test with LMREnabled=false → -0.97 ± 5.52 ELO (neutral baseline confirmed)
2. **Phase 2 (✅ COMPLETE):** Test with LMREnabled=true → -11.62 ± 10.36 ELO (needs move ordering)
3. **Phase 3 (NEXT):** Test with history heuristic implemented
4. **Phase 4 (PLANNED):** Test with both history and killer moves
5. **Phase 5 (FINAL):** Enable by default and validate +50-100 ELO gain

#### Integration Plan:

**Step 1: Immediate Testing (This Week)**
- Test current state with LMREnabled=false (should be neutral)
- Test current state with LMREnabled=true, minMoveNumber=8 (should not lose ELO)
- If acceptable, create integration branch and merge docs to main

**Step 2: History Heuristic Implementation (Next Week)**
```bash
git checkout main
git feature history-heuristic
# Implement history tables for quiet move ordering
# Test as standalone feature (should gain 20-30 ELO)
# Merge to main when validated
```

**Step 3: Killer Moves Implementation (Following Week)**
```bash
git checkout main  
git feature killer-moves
# Implement killer move heuristic
# Test as standalone feature (should gain 10-20 ELO)
# Merge to main when validated
```

**Step 4: LMR Integration (After Prerequisites)**
```bash
git checkout integration/lmr-with-move-ordering
git rebase main  # Now has history heuristic and killer moves
# Change LMREnabled default to true
# Test thoroughly - should now gain 50-100 ELO
# Merge to main when validated
```

#### Documentation Files:
- Implementation Plan: `/workspace/project_docs/planning/stage18_lmr_implementation_plan.md`
- Chess Expert Analysis: Documented in deferred_items_tracker.md
- Unit Tests: `/workspace/tests/test_lmr.cpp`, `/workspace/tests/test_lmr_simple.cpp`

#### Key Lessons:
1. **Move ordering is critical for LMR** - cannot work with random quiet moves
2. **Sequencing matters** - history/killers should come before LMR
3. **Stage 11 was correct** - MVV-LVA properly scoped to captures only
4. **Integration branches preserve work** - allows proper dependency management

## Completed Integration Branches

*None yet - this is the first integration branch for SeaJay*

## Integration Branch Management

### Creating a New Integration Branch

1. **Identify Dependencies:** Clearly document what prerequisites are missing
2. **Fix Current Issues:** Get the feature to a "correct but disabled" state  
3. **Create Branch:** `git integration <descriptive-name>`
4. **Document Here:** Add comprehensive entry to this file
5. **Plan Dependencies:** Create concrete plan for implementing prerequisites
6. **Update Status:** Keep this document updated as work progresses

### Monitoring Integration Branches

Use these commands to track integration branch status:

```bash
# List all integration branches
git list-integrations

# Show status with dates
git integration-status

# Check for merge conflicts
git checkout integration/branch-name
git merge --no-commit --no-ff main
git merge --abort  # Don't actually merge, just check
```

### Integration Branch Checklist

For each integration branch, ensure:
- [ ] Comprehensive documentation in this file
- [ ] Clear list of unmet dependencies  
- [ ] Concrete plan for implementing dependencies
- [ ] Feature is disabled by default (safe to merge docs)
- [ ] Regular rebasing/merging from main to avoid conflicts
- [ ] Testing strategy defined for when dependencies are ready

---

## Notes

- Integration branches are long-lived (weeks to months)
- Keep dependencies as separate, testable features
- Document everything - future developers need to understand the plan
- Update this file whenever branch status changes
- Delete branches only after successful integration to main

This system ensures no work is lost while maintaining clean development practices and testable incremental progress.
