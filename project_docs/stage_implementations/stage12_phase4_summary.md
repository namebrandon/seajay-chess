# Stage 12 Phase 4: TT Read-Only Integration - Complete

## Summary
Successfully implemented Phase 4 of Stage 12, adding read-only transposition table integration to the search. The implementation was broken into 5 careful sub-phases to ensure correctness at each step.

## Implementation Details

### Sub-phase 4A: Basic Probe Infrastructure (✓ Complete)
- Added TT probing in negamax without using results
- Tracked probe and hit statistics
- Verified no crashes or search disruption
- **Result**: TT probing infrastructure working correctly

### Sub-phase 4B: Draw Detection Order (✓ Complete)  
- Established critical ordering:
  1. Checkmate/stalemate detection FIRST
  2. Repetition check SECOND
  3. Fifty-move rule check THIRD
  4. TT probe LAST
- Never probe TT at root (ply == 0)
- **Result**: Correct draw detection order maintained

### Sub-phase 4C: Use TT for Cutoffs (✓ Complete)
- Implemented EXACT bound handling
- Added LOWER bound (fail-high) handling  
- Added UPPER bound (fail-low) handling
- Window adjustment and cutoff detection
- **Result**: TT cutoff logic in place (will activate with storing)

### Sub-phase 4D: Mate Score Adjustment (✓ Complete)
- Mate scores adjusted relative to current ply
- Positive mate: score - ply
- Negative mate: score + ply
- Constants: MATE_SCORE=30000, MATE_BOUND=29000
- **Result**: Mate scores handled correctly

### Sub-phase 4E: TT Move Ordering (✓ Complete)
- Extract move from TT entry
- Place TT move first in move ordering
- Works even if depth insufficient (just for ordering)
- Track TT move effectiveness
- **Result**: TT move ordering infrastructure ready

## Code Changes

### Modified Files:
1. **src/search/types.h**
   - Added TT statistics to SearchData
   - ttProbes, ttHits, ttCutoffs, ttMoveHits

2. **src/search/negamax.h/cpp**
   - Added TranspositionTable* parameter
   - Implemented all 5 sub-phases
   - Enhanced move ordering with TT move

3. **src/search/search.cpp**
   - Updated to pass TT parameter through

4. **tests/test_tt_integration.cpp**
   - Comprehensive test for all sub-phases

## Test Results
```
Sub-phase 4A: Basic Probe Infrastructure... ✓
Sub-phase 4B: Draw Detection Order... ✓  
Sub-phase 4C: TT Cutoffs... ✓
Sub-phase 4D: Mate Score Adjustment... ✓
Sub-phase 4E: TT Move Ordering... ✓
```

## Statistics Observed
- TT probes occurring correctly
- 0% hit rate (expected - no stores yet)
- 0 stores (correct - read-only phase)
- No crashes or incorrect behavior

## Next Steps
**Phase 5: Search Integration - Write**
- Add TT storing after search
- Handle mate score adjustment for storage
- Implement replacement strategy
- Validate with SPRT testing

## Key Learnings
1. Breaking into sub-phases essential for correctness
2. Draw detection order is critical
3. Mate score adjustment needed for both storage and retrieval
4. TT move ordering can work even without valid depth

## Status
✅ **Phase 4 COMPLETE** - Ready for Phase 5
