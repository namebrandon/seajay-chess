## Critical Checkpoints

**STOP and validate after:**
- Every mask generation (Step 1A)
- Every magic validation (Step 1C)
- First square's table (Step 2B)
- First integration (Step 3A)
- First perft test (Step 3C)
- First 100 games (Step 4C)

## Time Estimates

- **Phase 0:** 4 hours (Day 1)
- **Phase 1:** 6 hours (Day 2)
- **Phase 2:** 8 hours (Day 3)
- **Phase 3:** 8 hours (Day 4)
- **Phase 4:** 8 hours (Day 5)
- **Phase 5:** 6 hours (Day 6)
- **Total:** 40 hours (6 days)

## Risk Mitigation Through Granularity

This granular approach:
1. **Validates after EVERY step** - catches bugs immediately
2. **Never implements more than 2 hours without testing**
3. **Has clear gates** - can't proceed if validation fails
4. **Allows for easy rollback** - each step is atomic
5. **Maintains METHODICAL VALIDATION theme** throughout

## The Golden Rule

> "If a step takes more than 2 hours without validation, break it down further."

This granular approach has saved me countless times. You always know exactly where a bug was introduced because you validate after every small change.

## Git Strategy

**Reference:** See [`stage10_git_strategy.md`](./stage10_git_strategy.md) for:
- Commit after each step
- Tag after each phase
- Rollback procedures
- Emergency recovery
