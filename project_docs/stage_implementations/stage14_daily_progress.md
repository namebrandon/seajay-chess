# Stage 14: Quiescence Search - Daily Progress Log

## Day 1: 2024-08-14

### Morning Session (Infrastructure & Stand-Pat)
- ✅ **Deliverable 1.1**: Created quiescence.h header structure
- ✅ **Deliverable 1.2**: Added safety constants (MAX_PLY, NODE_LIMIT, etc.)

- ✅ **Deliverable 1.4**: Implemented minimal quiescence with stand-pat logic
- ✅ **Deliverable 1.5**: Added repetition detection
- ✅ **Deliverable 1.6**: Added time check mechanism

### Afternoon Session (Integration & Capture Search)
- ✅ **Deliverable 1.7**: Integrated quiescence into negamax
  - Added ENABLE_QUIESCENCE compile flag
  - Modified negamax to call quiescence at depth <= 0
  - Verified compile-time switching works
  
- ✅ **Deliverable 1.8**: Added UCI kill switch
  - Added "UseQuiescence" UCI option (default true)
  - Added runtime control via SearchLimits/SearchData
  - Tested enable/disable works correctly
  
- ✅ **Deliverable 1.9**: Implemented capture generation and search
  - Generate captures using MoveGenerator::generateCaptures()
  - Apply MVV-LVA ordering when available
  - Implement alpha-beta pruning in capture search
  - Limit to MAX_CAPTURES_PER_NODE (32)
  - **Key Test**: Position with tactics shows seldepth 5 at depth 1
  
- ✅ **Deliverable 1.10**: Implemented check evasion
  - Detect check status at start of quiescence
  - Generate ALL legal moves when in check (not just captures)
  - Skip stand-pat evaluation when in check
  - Handle checkmate detection (return mate score)
  - No move limit when searching check evasions
  - **Key Test**: Check positions correctly generate all evasions

## Progress Summary

### Completed Features
1. **Stand-Pat Evaluation**: Basic quiescence with static eval cutoff
2. **Safety Mechanisms**: Ply limits, time checks, repetition detection
3. **Capture Search**: Full recursive capture search with MVV-LVA
4. **Check Evasion**: Complete handling of in-check positions
5. **Integration**: Fully integrated with negamax search
6. **UCI Control**: Runtime enable/disable option

### Key Validation Results
- ✅ Quiescence extends selective depth (seldepth > depth)
- ✅ Tactical positions show deep quiescence (seldepth 5+ at depth 1)
- ✅ Check evasions work correctly
- ✅ No stack overflow or infinite loops
- ✅ Time management works in quiescence
- ✅ Compile-time and runtime controls both functional

### Test Positions Used
```
// Tactical position with captures
"r2qkb1r/pp1n1ppp/2p1pn2/3p4/2PP4/2N1PN2/PP3PPP/R1BQKB1R w KQkq - 0 7"
Result: depth 1, seldepth 5, showing quiescence extends search

// Check evasion test
"4k3/8/8/8/8/8/4Q3/4K3 b - - 0 1"
Result: Correctly generates 4 legal moves (all king moves)

// Position with hanging piece
"rnbqkb1r/pppp1ppp/5n2/4p3/2B1P3/8/PPPP1PPP/RNBQK1NR w KQkq - 0 4"
Result: Bishop captures f7 pawn found
```

### Next Steps (Day 2)
- [ ] Delta pruning in quiescence
- [ ] Checking moves in quiescence (optional)
- [ ] SEE (Static Exchange Evaluation) for pruning bad captures
- [ ] Performance testing and optimization
- [ ] SPRT validation against baseline

## Critical Deviation Fix (Evening Session)

### IMPORTANT: Progressive Node Limit System Added
**Issue Discovered**: We deviated from the original plan by hard-coding NODE_LIMIT_PER_POSITION = 10000 instead of implementing the progressive limit removal system specified in the design.

**Why This Matters**: Without progressive limits, we risked:
1. Leaving restrictive limits in production code
2. Not being able to test with appropriate safety during development
3. Forgetting to remove limiters before final release

**Solution Implemented**:
- ✅ Added compile-time progressive limit system:
  - `QSEARCH_TESTING`: 10,000 node limit (for safe development)
  - `QSEARCH_TUNING`: 100,000 node limit (for parameter tuning)
  - Production (default): No limit (UINT64_MAX)
- ✅ Added actual node limit enforcement (was missing!)
- ✅ Created dedicated build scripts to prevent forgetting flags:
  - `./build_testing.sh` - Development with 10K limit
  - `./build_tuning.sh` - Tuning with 100K limit
  - `./build_production.sh` - Full strength, no limits
  - `./build_debug.sh` - Debug with sanitizers
- ✅ Updated UCI to show mode at startup: "Quiescence: TESTING MODE - 10K limit"
- ✅ Created verification script: `./check_mode.sh` to verify build mode

**Build System Enhancement**:
- Main `build.sh` now accepts mode parameter: `./build.sh testing|tuning|production`
- CMAKE option available: `-DQSEARCH_MODE=TESTING|TUNING|PRODUCTION`
- Default is PRODUCTION to avoid accidentally leaving limits in place
- All binaries now clearly indicate their mode at runtime

**Files Modified for Fix**:
- `/workspace/src/search/quiescence.h` - Progressive limit system
- `/workspace/src/search/quiescence.cpp` - Node limit enforcement
- `/workspace/src/search/types.h` - Added qsearchNodesLimited counter
- `/workspace/CMakeLists.txt` - CMAKE option for mode selection
- `/workspace/src/uci/uci.cpp` - Display mode at startup
- Created 4 build scripts for convenience
- Created `/workspace/BUILD_MODES.md` - Complete user guide
- Updated `/workspace/CLAUDE.md` - Build instructions

**Documentation Created**:
- `/workspace/project_docs/stage_implementations/stage14_deviation_fixes.md`
- `/workspace/project_docs/stage_implementations/stage14_critical_fix_summary.md`
- `/workspace/BUILD_MODES.md` - User guide for build modes

This fix ensures we can safely develop with limits while guaranteeing production builds have full strength.

## Notes
- Implementation is more integrated than originally planned (no separate quiescenceInCheck function)
- MVV-LVA ordering significantly improves cutoff rate
- Safety limits prevent search explosion
- Check evasion is critical for avoiding horizon effect in tactical positions
- Progressive limit system ensures safe development and full production strength
