- Zero heap allocations during search
- Insufficient material detection working
- Performance optimized (795K+ NPS maintained)
- Debug instrumentation wrapped in DEBUG guards

### ✅ Deferred Items Documented
The following items were properly deferred to Phase 3:
- Fifty-move rule implementation
- UCI draw claim handling
- Architecture refactoring for proper separation
- Various performance optimizations documented in deferred_items_tracker.md

### ✅ Known Bugs Updated

- Cleaned up root directory
- Preserved important SPRT result directories

### ✅ Git Repository Clean
- All tracked files updated appropriately
- Test scripts properly organized
- No unnecessary files at root level

### ✅ Project Status Updated
- project_status.md reflects Phase 2 completion
- All stages marked as complete
- Strength and performance metrics documented

### ✅ README.md Updated
- Playing strength added (~1,000 ELO)
- Phase/stage listings reconciled with Master Project Plan
- Phase 2 marked as COMPLETE

### ✅ Version Confirmed
- Engine version is 2.9.1-draw-detection in uci.cpp

## Stage 9b Summary

Stage 9b successfully implemented draw detection with threefold repetition handling. The dual-mode history system ensures zero allocations during search while maintaining game history for repetition detection. Performance was preserved at 795K+ NPS.

External SPRT testing validated the engine's strength at approximately 1,000 ELO, meeting expectations for Phase 2 completion. The engine dominates sub-800 ELO opponents and struggles against 1200+ ELO opponents, confirming its intermediate strength level.

## Phase 2 Completion

With Stage 9b complete, Phase 2 (Basic Search and Evaluation) is now FINISHED. The engine has achieved:
- Material evaluation
- 4-ply negamax search with iterative deepening
- Alpha-beta pruning with 90% node reduction
- Piece-Square Table positional evaluation
- Draw detection and repetition handling
- ~1,000 ELO playing strength

Ready to proceed to Phase 3: Essential Optimizations (targeting 1,500+ ELO).
