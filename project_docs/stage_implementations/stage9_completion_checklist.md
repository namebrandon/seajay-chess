# Stage 9 Completion Checklist - Positional Evaluation with PST

**Stage:** 9 - Positional Evaluation  
**Date Completed:** August 10, 2025  
**Version:** 2.9.0-dev  

## Pre-Implementation ✅
- [x] Reviewed Master Project Plan requirements
- [x] Checked deferred items tracker
- [x] Got cpp-pro agent review
- [x] Got chess-engine-expert review
- [x] Created comprehensive implementation plan

## Implementation ✅
- [x] Created PST header with data structures (`src/evaluation/pst.h`)
- [x] Added PST values using simplified PeSTO tables
- [x] Integrated PST tracking in Board class
  - [x] Added `m_pstScore` member variable
  - [x] Added `recalculatePSTScore()` method
  - [x] Updated `UndoInfo` structure with PST delta
- [x] Updated make/unmake for PST
  - [x] Normal moves
  - [x] Castling (both king AND rook)
  - [x] En passant (captured pawn on different square)
  - [x] Promotion (remove pawn, add promoted piece)
- [x] Modified evaluation function to combine material + PST
- [x] Added MVV-LVA capture ordering
- [x] Created unit tests
- [x] Created integration tests

## Critical Requirements ✅
- [x] Evaluation symmetry maintained
- [x] Rank mirroring uses `sq ^ 56` (NOT `sq ^ 63`)
- [x] No pawn values on 1st/8th ranks
- [x] FEN loading recalculates PST from scratch
- [x] All special moves handled correctly

## Testing ✅
- [x] PST tables properly initialized
- [x] Knights prefer center squares
- [x] Pawns get advancement bonus
- [x] Kings prefer castled positions
- [x] Rank mirroring works correctly
- [x] Incremental updates match recalculation
- [x] Make/unmake maintains PST integrity
- [x] Evaluation symmetry verified

## Performance ✅
- [x] No significant NPS regression
- [x] Incremental updates working (no full recalculation)
- [x] MVV-LVA improves capture ordering

## Documentation ✅
- [x] Updated project_status.md
- [x] Implementation plan reviewed and followed
- [x] Code comments added for PST logic
- [x] Stage completion checklist created

## Known Issues / Deferred Items
- SPRT validation pending (requires longer test run)
- Quiescence search deferred to Stage 9b or later
- Tapered evaluation (mg/eg interpolation) deferred to Phase 3
- More sophisticated PST values can be tuned later

## Validation Results
- All existing tests continue to pass
- PST-specific tests pass
- Move generation unchanged (perft still valid)
- Search functionality intact

## Files Modified
1. `/workspace/src/evaluation/pst.h` - NEW: PST infrastructure
2. `/workspace/src/core/board.h` - Added PST tracking
3. `/workspace/src/core/board.cpp` - PST incremental updates
4. `/workspace/src/core/board_safety.h` - Updated undo structures
5. `/workspace/src/evaluation/evaluate.cpp` - Combined material + PST
6. `/workspace/src/search/negamax.cpp` - MVV-LVA ordering
7. `/workspace/tests/test_pst.cpp` - NEW: PST tests
8. `/workspace/tests/test_pst_simple.cpp` - NEW: Simple PST validation
9. `/workspace/project_docs/project_status.md` - Updated status

## Next Steps
1. Run SPRT validation (Stage 9 vs Stage 8)
2. Consider implementing quiescence search (Stage 9b)
3. Complete Phase 2 and move to Phase 3

## Notes
- PST implementation kept simple and focused
- Used conservative values (-50 to +50 centipawns)
- Incremental updates working correctly
- All edge cases handled (castling, en passant, promotion)
- Ready for SPRT validation

---

**Sign-off:** Stage 9 implementation complete and validated. PST successfully integrated with proper handling of all special moves. Expected +150-200 Elo improvement pending SPRT confirmation.
