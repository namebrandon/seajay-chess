# Stage 8: Alpha-Beta Pruning - Implementation Checklist

**Stage:** Phase 2, Stage 8  
**Date Started:** [To be filled]  
**Target Completion:** [To be filled]  

## Pre-Implementation Checklist
- [x] Pre-Stage Planning Process completed
- [x] Implementation plan reviewed by cpp-pro agent
- [x] Implementation plan reviewed by chess-engine-expert agent
- [x] Risk analysis completed
- [x] Deferred items tracker reviewed
- [x] Success criteria defined

## Implementation Tasks

### Phase 1: Enable Beta Cutoffs
- [ ] Activate break statement at line 142 in negamax.cpp
- [ ] Verify fail-soft implementation
- [ ] Add debug assertion for alpha < beta
- [ ] Basic functionality test

### Phase 2: Search Statistics
- [ ] Extend SearchInfo with beta cutoff counters
- [ ] Add totalMoves counter
- [ ] Implement effectiveBranchingFactor() calculation
- [ ] Implement moveOrderingEfficiency() calculation
- [ ] Add statistics to UCI info output

### Phase 3: Move Ordering
- [ ] Implement orderMoves() function
- [ ] Order promotions first
- [ ] Order captures second
- [ ] Leave quiet moves last
- [ ] Apply ordering in negamax after move generation
- [ ] Unit test the ordering function

### Phase 4: Validation Framework
- [ ] Create SearchComparison structure
- [ ] Implement comparison test (with/without alpha-beta)
- [ ] Add Bratko-Kopec 1 test
- [ ] Add Fine #70 test
- [ ] Add Kiwipete depth 4 test
- [ ] Verify all tests show identical moves/scores

### Phase 5: SPRT Testing
- [ ] Build seajay-negamax version (Stage 7)
- [ ] Build seajay-alphabeta version (Stage 8)
- [ ] Configure SPRT test parameters
- [ ] Run SPRT test
- [ ] Document results

## Validation Checklist

### Correctness Validation
- [ ] Best move unchanged for 50+ positions
- [ ] Score unchanged for all positions
- [ ] Special positions tested (stalemate, zugzwang)
- [ ] No crashes or memory leaks

### Performance Validation
- [ ] Node reduction >65% at depth 4
- [ ] First-move cutoff rate >60%
- [ ] Effective branching factor <6
- [ ] Depth 6 reached in <1 second from start

### Edge Cases
- [ ] Zugzwang position handled correctly
- [ ] Stalemate detection still works
- [ ] Repetition detection unaffected
- [ ] Mate scores correct

## Documentation Updates
- [ ] Update project_status.md
- [ ] Update deferred items tracker
- [ ] Create Stage 8 validation report
- [ ] Update CLAUDE.md if needed
- [ ] Git commit with proper attribution

## Sign-off Criteria
- [ ] All implementation tasks complete
- [ ] All validation tests passing
- [ ] SPRT test shows equivalent strength
- [ ] Performance targets met
- [ ] Documentation updated
- [ ] No known bugs introduced
