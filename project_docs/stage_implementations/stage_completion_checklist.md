# COMPLETION CHECKLIST AND STEPS TO REVIEW BEFORE MOVING TO A NEW STAGE

## Questions we ask ourselves

If we review the current stage deliverables form the SeaJay Chess Engien Development - Master Project Plan.md document, have we succesfully completed and tested all deliverables?

If we have not completed any deliverables, or only partially completed them, have we noted this in detail in our project_docs/tracking/deferred_items_tracker.md file? If not, we must do so.

Have we identified any bugs from our work on this stage? If so, do they exist in the project_docs/tracking/known_bugs.md file? If not, we must add them using the standard bug template.

If we did any SPRT testing, have we logged the results in project_docs/testing/SPRT_Result_Log.md ? If not, we must do so.

Have we cleaned up any "extra" files such as test scripts, debug scripts, analyze scripts, trace scripts, verify scripts or more that are no longer needed? If we want to keep them, we must document them extensively and put them an appropriate folder in our directory structure, not leave them at the root (unless warranted). If the stage is not complete, we can still keep them temporarily.

Is our git repo is a healthy and accurate state? Do we have any maintenance there to perform?

Has the project_docs/project_status.md document been updated recently and with appropriate content? Have we reviewed it for outdated information and removed anything that no longer applies? If not, we should do so.

Has anything significant or materially changed that would impact our README.md file? If so, we should note it.

Is our README.md accurate and up-to-date? If not, we need to make sure it is.

Once we are confident that all of these items are appropriately addressed, we should commit our code with a detailed message for historical reference.
