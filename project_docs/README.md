## Documentation Requirements

### MANDATORY Documentation Points

#### Before Starting Any Stage:
1. Complete pre-stage planning process
2. Create stage-specific planning document in `/planning/`
3. Review and update `deferred_items_tracker.md`

#### During Stage Development:
1. Update `project_status.md` with progress
2. Document significant decisions and changes
3. Track any newly deferred items

#### After Completing Each Stage:
1. **MANDATORY**: Complete the [Stage Completion Checklist](stage_implementations/stage_completion_checklist.md)
2. Create comprehensive summary in `/stage_implementations/`
3. Update `project_status.md` with completion status
4. Update `deferred_items_tracker.md` with any new deferrals
5. Add development diary entry in `dev_diary.md`
6. Archive completed checklist with stage documentation

## Documentation Standards

### File Naming Convention
- Planning documents: `stage[N]_[feature_name]_plan.md`
- Implementation summaries: `stage[N]_[feature_name]_summary.md`
- Use lowercase with underscores for multi-word names

### Document Headers
Every document should include:
```markdown
# Title
**Document Version:** X.X
**Date Created:** YYYY-MM-DD
**Last Updated:** YYYY-MM-DD
**Author:** [Name]
**Stage:** Phase X, Stage Y - [Name]
```

### Content Requirements
- Clear section headers with markdown hierarchy
- Code examples in fenced code blocks with language specification
- Tables for comparison or structured data
- Links to related documents where appropriate
- Version history for significant updates

## Quality Checklist

Before committing documentation:
- [ ] Spell check completed
- [ ] Technical accuracy verified
- [ ] Cross-references updated
- [ ] File in correct directory
- [ ] Headers properly formatted
- [ ] Related documents updated

## Documentation Philosophy

### Why Comprehensive Documentation Matters
1. **Knowledge Preservation** - Captures decisions and rationale
2. **Onboarding** - Helps future contributors understand the project
3. **Debugging** - Historical context aids in problem-solving
4. **Quality Assurance** - Documents serve as specification
5. **Progress Tracking** - Clear record of what's been accomplished

### Best Practices
- Write documentation as if explaining to your future self
- Include both WHAT was done and WHY decisions were made
- Document failures and lessons learned, not just successes
- Keep technical and narrative documentation separate but linked
- Update documentation immediately after changes, not later
