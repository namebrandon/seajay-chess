## Development Notes

### Design Decisions
- **C++20**: Chosen for modern features (concepts, bit operations, ranges)
- **Hybrid Architecture**: Bitboard + mailbox for optimal performance
- **AMD64 Target**: Ensuring consistent performance characteristics
- **DevContainer**: Reproducible development environment

### Technical Debt
None accumulated yet.

### Performance Targets
- Phase 1: Correct move generation (speed not critical)
- Phase 2: ~500K NPS
- Phase 3: >1M NPS
- Phase 4: >1M NPS with NNUE
