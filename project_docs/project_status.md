  - Created development container configuration
  - Configured external tools setup scripts
- **Stage 1 Completed**
  - Implemented hybrid bitboard-mailbox board representation
  - Created basic chess types (Square, Piece, Color, etc.)
  - Developed bitboard utility functions
  - Added FEN parsing and board display
  - Initialized Zobrist hashing infrastructure
  - Created comprehensive unit tests

## Phase Progress

### Phase 1: Foundation and Move Generation
**Status:** In Progress  
**Target Completion:** TBD  

#### Stage 1 - Board Representation
**Status:** Completed (December 2024)
- [x] Hybrid bitboard-mailbox data structure
- [x] 64-square mailbox array
- [x] 12 bitboards for piece positions
- [x] Occupied/empty square bitboards
- [x] Initial Zobrist key infrastructure
- [x] **Basic ray-based sliding piece move generation (temporary implementation)**
  - Ray-based rook attack generation
  - Ray-based bishop attack generation 
  - Ray-based queen attack generation (rook + bishop)
  - Will be replaced with magic bitboards in Phase 3
- [x] Unit tests for board operations
- [x] Unit tests for sliding piece attacks

#### Stage 2 - Position Management
**Status:** Completed (August 2024)
- [x] Result<T,E> error handling system for C++20
- [x] Enhanced FEN parser with parse-to-temp-validate-swap pattern
- [x] Buffer overflow protection and comprehensive input validation
- [x] Zobrist key rebuilding from scratch after FEN parsing
- [x] Position hash function for testing (separate from Zobrist)
- [x] validateNotInCheck() placeholder (deferred to Stage 4)
- [x] validateBitboardSync() for consistency checking
- [x] validateZobrist() for key validation
- [x] Comprehensive test suite with expert positions
- [x] Round-trip consistency testing
- [x] Debug display functions with validation status

#### Stage 3 - Basic UCI and Legal Moves
- [ ] Minimal UCI protocol
- [ ] Pseudo-legal move generation
- [ ] Legal move filtering
- [ ] Move format (16-bit)
- [ ] Random move selection
- [ ] GUI compatibility testing

#### Stage 4 - Special Moves and Validation
- [ ] Castling implementation
- [ ] En passant capture
- [ ] Pawn promotion
- [ ] Make/unmake move
- [ ] Perft implementation
- [ ] Perft validation tests

#### Stage 5 - Testing Infrastructure
- [ ] Install fast-chess
- [ ] Implement bench command
- [ ] Automated testing scripts
- [ ] SPRT configuration
- [ ] Opening book setup

## Code Metrics

### Lines of Code
- Source Code (C++): ~450
- Tests: ~200
- Scripts: ~200
- Documentation: ~1000

## Known Issues

None at this time (pre-development phase).

## Next Steps

### Immediate (Stage 1)
1. Create initial board representation classes
2. Implement bitboard utilities
3. Set up mailbox array
4. Create basic types and constants
5. Write initial unit tests

### Short Term (Stages 2-3)
1. Implement FEN parsing
2. Create move generation
3. Add UCI protocol basics
4. Achieve GUI compatibility

### Medium Term (Stages 4-5)
1. Complete special moves
2. Pass perft validation
3. Set up testing infrastructure
4. Begin SPRT testing

## Development Notes

### Design Decisions
- **C++20**: Chosen for modern features (concepts, bit operations, ranges)
- **Hybrid Architecture**: Bitboard + mailbox for optimal performance
- **AMD64 Target**: Ensuring consistent performance characteristics
- **DevContainer**: Reproducible development environment

### Technical Debt
None accumulated yet.

### Performance Targets
- Phase 1: Correct move generation (speed not critical)
- Phase 2: ~500K NPS
- Phase 3: >1M NPS
- Phase 4: >1M NPS with NNUE
