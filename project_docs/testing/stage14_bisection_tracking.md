# Stage 14 Bisection Testing - Compilation Fix Tracking

## Purpose
Track compilation fixes needed for Stage 14 phase commits to enable OpenBench bisection testing.

## Testing Strategy
Test each phase sequentially to identify when -350 ELO regression was introduced:
1. Stage 13 ‚Üí Phase 1
2. Phase 1 ‚Üí Phase 2  
3. Phase 2 ‚Üí Phase 3

### üîç Critical Finding: Phase 3 is the Culprit

**Phase 1 Result:** +14 ELO improvement over Stage 13 baseline
- Removing compile-time flags actually improved performance slightly
- This phase is CLEAN

**Phase 2 Result:** +13.90 ¬± 20.96 ELO over Stage 13 baseline  
- Algorithm improvements (best move tracking, TT bounds, delta pruning) are working correctly
- Pentanomial: [2, 28, 78, 40, 2] shows stable performance
- **IMPORTANT: Phase 2's changes were ALL CORRECT and beneficial!**
- This phase is CLEAN

**Phase 3 Confirmed:** The -350 ELO catastrophic regression source
- Static eval caching optimization was fundamentally broken
- Tried to use parent position's eval for child position
- Fix confirmed to resolve the issue

## üêõ Root Cause Analysis: Multiple Bugs in Phase 3

### Testing Results Summary
After extensive testing, we identified Phase 3 had MULTIPLE critical bugs:

1. **TT Poisoning Bug (FIXED)**: Storing minus_infinity (-32768) in TT when in check
2. **Fundamental Static Eval Caching Flaw (ROOT CAUSE)**: Using parent's position eval for child position

### The Real Bug: Broken Static Eval Caching

### The Fundamental Flaw in Static Eval Caching

Phase 3 attempted to cache static evaluations to avoid redundant eval calls, but made a **catastrophic conceptual error**:

```cpp
// Phase 3's flawed logic:
// 1. Parent evaluates position A (before move)
// 2. Parent makes capture move to reach position B  
// 3. Parent passes position A's eval to child as "cached"
// 4. Child uses position A's eval for position B!
```

**This is fundamentally wrong!** You cannot use the evaluation of one position as the evaluation of a completely different position after a move has been made.

### Testing Journey to Find the Bug

1. **First Hypothesis**: Negation issue (negamax requires flipping signs)
   - Tested with fix: Still -330 ELO loss
   
2. **Second Hypothesis**: TT poisoning with minus_infinity values
   - Fixed storing -32768 in TT when in check
   - Tested alone: Still -350 ELO loss
   
3. **Combined Testing**: Both negation + TT poisoning fixes
   - Result: Still -350 ELO loss
   
4. **Final Discovery**: The caching itself is broken
   - Parent's eval (before move) != Child's eval (after move)
   - Completely different positions cannot share evaluations!

### The Fix
Remove the entire static eval caching mechanism:
- Don't pass cached eval to children
- Always evaluate fresh at each node
- Accept the performance cost to fix the -350 ELO bug

### NPS Analysis (Not the Problem)
All phases show consistent NPS around 915K-930K, indicating the regression is algorithmic, not performance-related:
- **Stage 13 Baseline:** 915,363 NPS
- **Stage 14 Phase 1:** 929,929 NPS  
- **Stage 14 Phase 2:** 921,545 NPS
- **Stage 14 Phase 3:** 929,470 NPS

## Workflow
1. **Fix compilation issues** in each phase commit
2. **Create bisection branches** with minimal fixes only
3. **Test on OpenBench** to isolate regression
4. **Document results** to identify problematic phase

## Branch Naming Convention
- `bisect/stage14-phase1-fixed` - Phase 1 with compilation fixes
- `bisect/stage14-phase2-fixed` - Phase 2 with compilation fixes  
- `bisect/stage14-phase3-fixed` - Phase 3 with compilation fixes

## Notes
- Only apply **minimal compilation fixes** - no functional changes
- Preserve original functionality as much as possible
- Document all changes made for bisection testing

## ‚úÖ RESOLUTION SUMMARY

### The Bug Was in Phase 3 ONLY
- **Phase 1**: Clean, +14 ELO improvement ‚úÖ
- **Phase 2**: Clean, +13.90 ELO improvement ‚úÖ  
- **Phase 3**: Catastrophic -350 ELO regression ‚ùå
- **Phase 3 Fixed**: Bug resolved but cumulative gain only +3.82 ELO ‚ö†Ô∏è

### Unexpected Finding
Despite fixing the catastrophic bug:
- Phase 1 + Phase 2 showed ~28 ELO gain individually
- But cumulative (all phases fixed) shows only ~4 ELO gain
- This suggests Phase 3's other changes may have negated improvements

### Current Investigation
Testing Phase 3 Fixed vs Phase 2 directly to determine if:
1. Phase 3's move ordering rewrite is problematic
2. Other Phase 3 changes (prefetching, etc.) hurt performance
3. There are negative interactions between phases

### Root Cause of Original Bug
Phase 3's "static eval caching optimization" was fundamentally broken:
- Attempted to pass parent position's evaluation to child position
- After a move, the position is completely different - can't reuse eval
- This is a conceptual error, not just an implementation bug

### The Fix Applied
- Remove the entire static eval caching mechanism
- Keep the TT poisoning fix (don't store minus_infinity)
- Accept the performance cost to restore correct evaluation

### Lessons Learned
1. **Performance optimizations can be dangerous** - always validate with ELO testing
2. **Phase 2 was falsely suspected** - its changes were all correct and beneficial
3. **Bisection testing is critical** - helped isolate the exact problematic commit
4. **Conceptual errors are harder to spot** - the code looked reasonable but the concept was flawed
