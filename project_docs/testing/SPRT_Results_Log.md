- **Concurrency:** 4-8 games

## Test History

### Test SPRT-2025-001 - Stage 7 Negamax Search
- **Date:** 2025-08-09
- **Versions:** 2.7.0-negamax vs 2.6.0-material
- **Feature:** 4-ply negamax search with iterative deepening
- **Hypothesis:** Negamax search will provide >200 Elo improvement over material-only evaluation
- **Parameters:** [0, 200] α=0.05 β=0.05
- **Time Control:** 10+0.1
- **Opening Book:** 4moves_test.pgn
- **Hardware:** Development container
- **Concurrency:** Sequential

#### Results
- **Decision:** PASS ✓ (H1 Accepted)
- **Games Played:** 16
- **Score:** 13-2-1 (84.38%)
- **ELO Estimate:** +292.96 ± 349.33
- **LLR:** 3.15 (106.8% of range)
- **Duration:** 3m 7s
- **LOS:** 100.00%

#### Analysis
Stage 7's 4-ply negamax search demonstrates overwhelming superiority over Stage 6's material-only evaluation. The test concluded after just 16 games with decisive results. Most games ended in checkmate, demonstrating Stage 7's tactical awareness. The engine consistently found mating attacks that Stage 6 missed. Only 1 draw in 16 games shows decisive play.

#### Action Taken
- Merged to master
- Updated version to 2.7.0-negamax
- Stage 7 marked complete

### Test SPRT-2025-08-09-001
- **Date:** 2025-08-09
- **Versions:** Stage 6 Material Eval vs Random (Phase 1 baseline)
- **Feature:** Material evaluation with single-ply lookahead
- **Hypothesis:** Material evaluation will significantly outperform random play
- **Parameters:** [0, 5] α=0.05 β=0.05
- **Time Control:** Quick test (10 games)
- **Opening Book:** Standard positions
- **Hardware:** Development container
- **Concurrency:** Sequential

#### Results
- **Decision:** INCONCLUSIVE ⋯
- **Games Played:** 10
- **Score:** 0-1-9 (45% draws)
- **ELO Estimate:** Insufficient data
- **Time Elapsed:** ~5 minutes

#### Analysis
Single-ply material evaluation alone is insufficient to show strength gains against random play. The engine correctly evaluates material but without search depth, it cannot capitalize on advantages. This is expected behavior - Stage 7's negamax search will enable the material evaluation to demonstrate effectiveness.

#### Conclusion
Test confirms Stage 6 implementation is working but needs Stage 7 (search) to show measurable strength improvement. No bugs identified; behavior is as expected for material-only evaluation.

## Hardware Specifications

### Primary Test Machine
```
CPU: [To be specified]
RAM: [To be specified]
OS: Ubuntu 22.04 (Docker)
Compiler: GCC 12
Build: Release with -O3 -march=native
```

### Build Configuration
```bash
cmake -DCMAKE_BUILD_TYPE=Release ..
make -j
```

## Testing Guidelines

1. **Always test against current master**
2. **Use consistent hardware within a phase**
3. **Document all parameters**
4. **Save all output files**
5. **Update this log immediately after test**

## Statistical Reference

### SPRT Bounds (Standard)
- **Lower Bound (H0):** LLR ≤ log(β/(1-α)) = log(0.05/0.95) ≈ -2.89
- **Upper Bound (H1):** LLR ≥ log((1-β)/α) = log(0.95/0.05) ≈ 2.89

### ELO Calculation
```
ELO = 400 * log10(wins/losses)
95% CI = ± 400/sqrt(games)
```

## Version Naming Convention

- **MAJOR.MINOR.PATCH-TAG**
  - MAJOR: Phase (1-7)
  - MINOR: Stage within phase
  - PATCH: Incremental improvement
  - TAG: Feature identifier

Examples:
- 1.5.0-master: Phase 1, Stage 5, baseline
- 2.1.0-material: Phase 2, Stage 1, material evaluation
- 2.2.0-negamax: Phase 2, Stage 2, negamax search
