Please update the development diary at project_docs/dev_diary.md with the latest project progress. Create the file and directory if they don't exist.

Examine recent git commits, code changes, test results, and any terminal outputs to construct an accurate account of what has happened since the last diary entry. 

## Important Instructions:

1. **Group all entries by date** using clear date headers formatted as: `## December 15, 2024`
2. Under each date, write in your engaging 'Dear Diary' style
3. Include timestamps for specific events within each day (e.g., "3:45 PM - Finally cracked the perft bug!")
4. Focus on:
   - Technical progress and implementations
   - Bugs encountered and how they were solved
   - Test results (perft counts, SPRT outcomes, ELO gains)
   - Design decisions and trade-offs
   - Lessons learned and "aha!" moments
   - The emotional journey (frustrations, breakthroughs, satisfactions)

If this is the first entry or the file doesn't exist, start with an introduction explaining this is the development diary for the SeaJay chess engine project.

Maintain strict chronological order and ensure each day's events are grouped together under that date's header. Write in a narrative style that someone would enjoy reading years from now to understand not just what was built, but how it felt to build it.

Look at the following to gather context:
- Git commit history
- Source files (*.cpp, *.h)
- Test output files
- Build logs
- Any existing diary entries to maintain continuity
