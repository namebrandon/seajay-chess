# SeaJay Chess Engine

A modern chess engine developed using C++20, featuring NNUE evaluation and advanced search techniques.

**Author:** Brandon Harris

## Project Status

Currently in Phase 1: Foundation and Move Generation

For detailed development planning, see:
- [Master Project Plan](project_docs/SeaJay%20Chess%20Engine%20Development%20-%20Master%20Project%20Plan.md) - Comprehensive development roadmap
- [Project Status](project_docs/project_status.md) - Current progress and implementation notes

## Development Philosophy

- **Single Feature Focus**: Each stage implements one feature with complete validation
- **Statistical Validation**: All improvements validated through SPRT testing
- **Performance First**: Optimized C++20 implementation with careful attention to speed
- **Hybrid Architecture**: Combines bitboard and mailbox representations

## Building

### Requirements
- C++20 compatible compiler (GCC 10+, Clang 10+, MSVC 2019+)
- CMake 3.16+
- Git

### Quick Start

```bash
# Clone the repository
git clone https://github.com/yourusername/seajay-chess.git
cd seajay-chess

# Create build directory
mkdir build && cd build

# Configure and build
cmake ..
make -j

# Run the engine (once Phase 1 Stage 3 is complete)
./bin/seajay
```

## Development Phases

1. **Phase 1**: Foundation and Move Generation
2. **Phase 2**: Basic Search and Evaluation
3. **Phase 3**: Essential Optimizations
4. **Phase 4**: NNUE Integration
5. **Phase 5**: Advanced Search Techniques
6. **Phase 6**: Refinements and Optimization
7. **Phase 7**: Custom NNUE Training

See `project_docs/` for detailed development plan.

## Testing

Testing infrastructure will be set up in Phase 1, Stage 5, including:
- Perft validation
- SPRT testing with fast-chess
- Unit tests
- Tactical test suites

## AI-Assisted Development

SeaJay is being developed through a unique collaboration between human expertise and AI assistance, leveraging the best of both worlds to create a high-quality chess engine.

### Development Partners

**Primary AI Assistant: Claude (Anthropic)**
- Architecture design and planning
- Code generation and implementation
- Bug detection and fixing
- Performance optimization suggestions
- Testing strategy development

**Specialized AI Agents:**
- **chess-engine-expert**: Deep expertise in chess engine algorithms, move generation, search techniques, evaluation functions, and NNUE implementation. Assists with debugging perft results, optimizing search functions, and implementing advanced techniques.
- **dev-diary-chronicler**: Documents the development journey in narrative form, capturing both technical progress and the human experience of building a chess engine from scratch.

### Development Methodology

1. **Human-Guided Direction**: Brandon Harris provides project vision, makes architectural decisions, and validates all implementations
2. **AI-Powered Implementation**: Claude assists with code generation, ensuring modern C++ best practices and chess engine conventions
3. **Collaborative Problem-Solving**: Complex bugs and optimizations are solved through iterative human-AI dialogue
4. **Transparent Attribution**: All AI contributions are acknowledged in commit messages and documentation

### Benefits of This Approach

- **Accelerated Development**: AI assistance speeds up boilerplate code and common pattern implementation
- **Knowledge Transfer**: AI brings expertise from analyzing thousands of chess engines
- **Code Quality**: Consistent style and modern C++ practices throughout
- **Documentation**: Comprehensive documentation generated alongside code
- **Learning Journey**: The development process itself becomes educational content

### Ethical Considerations

- All AI-generated code is reviewed and understood before integration
- The project maintains transparency about AI involvement
- The goal is to demonstrate effective human-AI collaboration in software development
- Performance claims will be independently verified through SPRT testing
