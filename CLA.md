## FAQ

**Q: Why is a CLA necessary?**
A: The CLA ensures that the Project Owner has the necessary rights to distribute the project under different licenses if needed, including potential commercial licenses for sustainability.

**Q: Can I withdraw my contribution?**
A: While you cannot revoke the rights granted for past contributions, you can choose not to make future contributions.

**Q: What happens to my contributions?**
A: Your contributions remain part of the open-source project (currently under GPL-3.0), but the Project Owner may also use them in commercially licensed versions.

**Q: Do I lose my rights to my contribution?**
A: No. You retain full rights to your contribution and can use it however you wish. You're simply granting the Project Owner additional rights.
