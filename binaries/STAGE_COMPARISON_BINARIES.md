# Stage Comparison Binaries for White Bias Investigation

## Purpose
These binaries were built to identify when the white bias bug was introduced by testing each stage in self-play.

## Testing Instructions

To test for white bias in self-play:

```bash
# Test Stage 7
./binaries/seajay-stage7-c09a377 <<EOF
position startpos
go depth 5
quit
EOF

# Run multiple games and track win rates
# If White wins >60% consistently, bias exists at this stage
```

## Expected Findings

Based on the investigation, we expect:
- Stage 7: Should be relatively balanced (material-only)
- Stage 8: Still material-only, should remain balanced
- Stage 9: PST introduced - likely where bias appears

The PST implementation in Stage 9 is the primary suspect because:
1. It introduces positional scoring for the first time
2. The sign handling for Black pieces has been problematic
3. Move ordering (a1-h8 via popLsb) combined with PST may create systematic bias
