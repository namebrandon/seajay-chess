- **Commit:** `6923fb1`
- **Bench:** 19191913
- **Test Result:** **+36.20 ± 11.09 ELO** ⚠️

- **OpenBench:** https://openbench.seajay-chess.dev/test/87/
- **Notes:** 30% bonus too high, double-counting issue identified

#### Phase PP3b-fixed: Connected Passers (10% bonus)
- **Commit:** `ec38ae1`
- **Bench:** 19191913
- **Test Result:** **+48.87 ± 10.89 ELO** ✅
- **Status:** ✅ WORKS but suboptimal (~7 ELO below PP3a)

#### Phase PP3b-v4: Connected Passers (20% bonus)
- **Commit:** `f6f7ce6`
- **Bench:** 19191913
- **Test Result:** **+60.77 ± 11.00 ELO** 🎉
- **Status:** ✅ EXCELLENT - Best result yet!
- **OpenBench:** https://openbench.seajay-chess.dev/test/90/
- **Notes:** 20% is optimal! Even better than PP3a alone

#### Phase PP3b-v5: Same-Rank Connected Passers Bonus (FLAWED)
- **Commit:** `712f0df`
- **Bench:** 19191913
- **Test Result:** **+45.99 ± 10.94 ELO** ❌
- **Status:** ❌ REGRESSION - Lost 15 ELO from v4
- **OpenBench:** https://openbench.seajay-chess.dev/test/91/
- **Notes:** CRITICAL BUG: Only one pawn of same-rank pair gets bonus (asymmetric)

#### Phase PP3b-final: Reverted to v4
- **Commit:** `3b200d0`
- **Bench:** 19191913
- **Status:** ✅ Reverted to proven PP3b-v4 implementation
- **Notes:** Keeping 20% uniform bonus, no same-rank special case

#### Phase PP3c: Blockader Evaluation
- **Commit:** `a4b7950`
- **Bench:** 19191913
- **Test Result:** **+63.10 ± 11.18 ELO** ✅

- **Status:** ❌ REGRESSION - Lost 11 ELO from PP3c
- **OpenBench:** https://openbench.seajay-chess.dev/test/93/
- **Notes:** Rook behind pawn evaluation not working as expected
- **REVERTED:** Returning to PP3c due to regression

### Planned Phases (Incremental Approach)

#### Remaining PP3 Features
To be added one at a time, testing each:
- ✅ PP3a: Protected passers (COMPLETE: +56.27 ELO)
- ✅ PP3b: Connected passers (COMPLETE: +60.77 ELO with 20%)
- ✅ PP3c: Blockader evaluation (COMPLETE: +63.10 ELO)
- ❌ PP3d: Rook behind passed pawn (FAILED - REVERTED)
- PP3e: King proximity (endgame only) (NEXT)
- PP3f: Unstoppable passer detection (PENDING)

#### Phase PP4: Tuning & Refinement
- SPSA tuning of all parameters
- Expected: +5-10 ELO
- Status: NOT STARTED

### Key Learnings

1. **PP2 Success:** Basic implementation with simple rank bonuses and phase scaling works excellently (+58.50 ELO)

2. **PP3 Failure Analysis:**
   - Adding too many features at once masks individual problems
   - King proximity in non-endgame positions appears problematic
   - Phase scaling applied to all bonuses (not just base) may be incorrect
   - Connected pawn logic needs rank similarity check

3. **PP3b Issues Identified:**
   - 30% bonus for connected passers is too high (causes 20 ELO regression)
   - Double-counting problem: both connected pawns get bonus
   - Rank difference of 2 is too lenient (should be ±1 max)
   - Solution: Reduce to 10%, only bonus more advanced pawn

4. **Expert Analysis on Connected Passers (Chess-Engine-Expert Consultation):**
   
   **How Top Engines Handle Connected Passers:**
   - **Stockfish:** Evaluates as a pair, 15-25% bonus, uses minimum rank of pair
   - **Ethereal:** Only more advanced pawn gets bonus, 12-20% range, strict adjacency
   - **Consensus:** 10-20% bonus range is optimal, applied once per pair
   
   **Key Implementation Patterns:**
   - **Leader-Follower Pattern (Recommended):** Only more advanced pawn gets bonus
   - **Pair Evaluation Pattern:** Detect pairs in pawn hash, apply once
   - **Rank Tolerance:** 0 or 1 rank difference is optimal (not 2)
   
   **Typical Bonus Ranges in Strong Engines:**
   - Base passed pawn: 100%
   - Connected bonus: +10-20%
   - Protected passer: +15-25%
   - Same-rank connected: +20-25% (especially strong)
   
   **Why Our PP3b Failed:**
   - 30% too high + double counting = 60% overvaluation
   - Connected passers are about mutual support, not doubling value
   - Conservative correctly-applied beats aggressive incorrectly-applied
   
   **Missing Features for Future Phases:**
   - Enemy king distance factor (more bonus if king far away)
   - Same-rank special case (extra 5% for pawns on same rank)
   - Unstoppable passer detection (6th/7th rank connected = huge bonus)
   - Better endgame scaling for connected passers

5. **PP3b-v5 Same-Rank Bug Analysis (Chess-Engine-Expert):**
   
   **The Asymmetry Problem:**
   - Our code: `if (rankOf(sq) >= rankOf(adjSq))` breaks for same-rank
   - Only right-file pawn gets 25%, left-file pawn gets 0%
   - Creates position-dependent evaluation (e5+f5 ≠ d5+e5)
   
   **How Top Engines Handle Same-Rank:**
   - **Stockfish:** Both pawns get smaller bonus (~10% each)
   - **Ethereal:** Distance-based approach, symmetric evaluation
   - **Key Principle:** BOTH pawns must get bonus or evaluation becomes inconsistent
   
   **Why Same-Rank Often Weaker Than Adjacent:**
   - No lever creation possible
   - Easier to blockade (single piece blocks both)
   - Must advance together (less flexible)
   - Enemy king can control both from one square
   
   **Fix Options:**
   - Revert to v4 (simplest, proven to work)
   - Give both pawns smaller bonus (10% each)
   - Use fixed bonus instead of percentage for same-rank

6. **PP3d Rook Behind Pawn Analysis (Chess-Engine-Expert):**
   
   **Problems Identified:**
   - Applied to ALL passed pawns (should be rank 5+ only)
   - Enemy rook behind isn't always bad (often good defense!)
   - Percentage bonuses compound unexpectedly
   - No check for clear path between rook and pawn
   
   **How Top Engines Handle:**
   - Only for advanced pawns (rank 5+)
   - Scaling with rank (bigger bonus as pawn advances)
   - Enemy rook behind only penalized for rank 6+ pawns
   - Use fixed additive bonuses, not percentages

7. **Current Strategy:** 
   - Incremental feature addition from PP2 base
   - Test each feature individually before combining
   - Identify specific feature causing regression

### Summary Statistics
- **Best Working Version:** PP3c with +63.10 ELO vs main
- **Target Total Gain:** +50-75 ELO
- **Current Progress:** 126% of minimum target, 84% of maximum target achieved
- **Features Successfully Added:**
  - Basic rank bonuses with phase scaling (PP2)
  - Protected passer bonus +20% (PP3a)
  - Connected passer bonus +20% (PP3b-v4)
  - Blockader penalties (PP3c)

### Next Steps
1. Continue with PP3e (King proximity in endgame only)
2. If successful, try PP3f (Unstoppable passer detection)
3. Consider PP4 (SPSA tuning) if gains plateau
4. Merge when satisfied with results

### Risk Mitigation
- All commits pushed to remote for OpenBench access
- Reverting to PP3c as stable baseline after PP3d failure
- Incremental testing approach to isolate problems
- Full documentation of each attempt for learning
