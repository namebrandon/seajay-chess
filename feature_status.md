# Feature: Passed Pawn Hash Refactoring

## Overview
Refactoring the Passed Pawns evaluation to use the pawn hash table that was implemented during the Doubled Pawns feature development. This will improve performance by caching passed pawn detection in the pawn hash table.

## Timeline
- **Start Date:** 2025-08-22
- **Branch:** feature/20250822-passed-pawn-hash-refactor
- **Base Commit:** 3cfcec2 (main)

## Current Status
The Passed Pawns feature was implemented before the pawn hash caching mechanism. Currently:
- Passed pawns are detected on every evaluation call
- The pawn hash exists but only caches isolated and doubled pawns
- We need to add passed pawn caching to the pawn hash

## Implementation Plan

### Phase PPH1: Cache Infrastructure
- Add passed pawn detection to pawn hash entry computation
- Store passed pawns bitboard in the cache
- No evaluation changes yet (just infrastructure)
- Expected ELO: 0 (infrastructure only)

### Phase PPH2: Use Cached Values
- Modify evaluation to use cached passed pawn bitboards
- Should maintain identical evaluation scores
- Expected ELO: +5-10 (from performance improvement)

## Phase Status

| Phase | Description | Commit | Bench | Test Result | Status |
|-------|------------|--------|-------|-------------|--------|
| PPH1 | Cache Infrastructure | a688725 | 19191913 | -0.38 Â± 11.83 | COMPLETE |
| PPH2 | Use Cached Values | - | - | - | IN PROGRESS |

## Testing Notes
- This is primarily a performance optimization
- Evaluation scores should remain identical
- Main benefit is reduced computation time
