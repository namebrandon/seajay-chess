# Bishop Pair Bonus Feature Implementation

## Overview
**Feature:** Bishop Pair Bonus
**Expected ELO Gain:** +20-30 ELO typical
**Reference:** 4ku engine uses S(29, 84) - 29cp midgame, 84cp endgame
**Branch:** feature/20250824-bishop-pair

## Timeline
- **Start Date:** 2025-08-24
- **Base Commit:** 861c724 (main)

## Implementation Plan

### Phase 1: Infrastructure (0 ELO expected)
- Add bishop pair detection logic
- No integration with evaluation yet
- Expected: 0 ELO (infrastructure only)
- SPRT Bounds: [-5.00, 3.00]

### Phase 2: Basic Integration (+15-20 ELO expected)
- Integrate bishop pair bonus into evaluation
- Use conservative values initially (20cp midgame, 50cp endgame)
- Expected: +15-20 ELO
- SPRT Bounds: [0.00, 8.00]

### Phase 3: Tuning (+5-10 ELO expected)
- Tune bishop pair values based on test results
- Target values closer to 4ku's S(29, 84)
- Expected: +5-10 ELO additional
- SPRT Bounds: [0.00, 5.00]

## Testing Summary

| Phase | Expected ELO | Actual ELO | Status | Notes |
|-------|-------------|------------|--------|-------|
| Phase 1 | 0 | TBD | Pending | Infrastructure only |
| Phase 2 | +15-20 | TBD | Pending | Basic integration |
| Phase 3 | +5-10 | TBD | Pending | Value tuning |

## Key Learnings
- TBD

## Implementation Details
- Bishop pair detection checks if a side has both bishops
- Bonus applied only when side has exactly 2 bishops
- Phase-scaled bonus (more valuable in endgame)
- Conservative initial values to ensure stability
