# Doubled Pawns Feature Implementation Status

## Overview
**Feature**: Doubled Pawns Evaluation  
**Branch**: `feature/20250822-doubled-pawns`  
**Expected Total ELO Gain**: +15-25 ELO  
**Start Date**: 2025-08-22  
**Status**: IN PROGRESS - Planning Complete

## Feature Description
Implement evaluation penalties for doubled pawns - pawns of the same color on the same file. This is a fundamental pawn structure weakness that limits mobility and creates targetable weaknesses.

## Implementation Plan

### Phase DP1: Infrastructure (0 ELO expected)
**Purpose**: Add doubled pawn detection infrastructure without integration  
**Expected Impact**: No performance change, validates compilation  
**Status**: COMPLETE

Implementation tasks:
- [x] Add doubled pawn fields to PawnEntry structure
- [x] Create detection helper functions (not called yet)
- [ ] Add unit tests for detection logic (deferred)
- [x] Verify compilation and no performance regression

### Phase DP2: Detection Without Penalty (0 ELO expected)  
**Purpose**: Integrate detection, verify accuracy with 0 penalty  
**Expected Impact**: No ELO change, slight performance overhead  
**Status**: COMPLETE

Implementation tasks:
- [x] Integrate detection into pawn evaluation
- [x] Count doubled pawns but apply 0 penalty value
- [ ] Add UCI info output for doubled pawn counts (deferred)
- [x] Validate detection with test positions
- [x] Verify < 2% performance impact

### Phase DP3: Apply Base Penalties (+15-25 ELO expected)
**Purpose**: Enable doubled pawn penalties with conservative values  
**Expected Impact**: +15-25 ELO improvement  
**Status**: PENDING

Implementation tasks:
- [ ] Set base penalty: -15 cp (midgame), -6 cp (endgame)  
- [ ] Apply penalty to all doubled pawns (not the base pawn)
- [ ] Handle multiple pawns per file (3 pawns = 2 penalties)
- [ ] Test with SPRT bounds [10, 30]

### Phase DP4: Isolated Interaction (Optional, +3-5 ELO expected)
**Purpose**: Reduce doubled penalty when also isolated  
**Expected Impact**: +3-5 ELO from better evaluation accuracy  
**Status**: PLANNED

Implementation tasks:
- [ ] Apply 60-70% doubled penalty when also isolated
- [ ] Verify no double-counting bugs
- [ ] Test interaction effects

### Future Enhancements (Post-MVP)
- File-based scaling (center 75%, edge 125%)
- Rank distance scaling  
- Connected doubled pawn bonus
- Doubled passed pawn exception
- SPSA tuning of all parameters

## Technical Design

### Detection Algorithm
```cpp
// Efficient detection per file
for (int file = 0; file < 8; file++) {
    int pawnCount = popcount(pawns & fileMask[file]);
    if (pawnCount > 1) {
        doubledPawnCount += (pawnCount - 1);
    }
}
```

### Key Requirements
1. **Multiple pawns**: File with N pawns has N-1 doubled penalties
2. **Pawn hash integration**: Cache in existing pawn hash table
3. **Performance target**: < 2% evaluation time increase
4. **Evaluation order**: Process after passed/isolated/backward

### Penalty Values
| Phase | Midgame | Endgame | Notes |
|-------|---------|---------|-------|
| DP1-2 | 0 | 0 | Detection only |
| DP3 | -15 | -6 | Base implementation |
| DP4 | -15 * 0.65 | -6 * 0.65 | When also isolated |
| Future | Scaled by file/rank | Scaled | SPSA tuned |

## Testing Strategy

### Validation Positions
1. **Basic doubled pawns**: 
   - Position with white pawns on e2, e3 (1 doubled)
   - Position with black pawns on h7, h6, h5 (2 doubled)

2. **Edge cases**:
   - Triple pawns on same file
   - Doubled isolated pawns
   - Doubled passed pawns

3. **Standard positions**:
   - French Defense structures (after ...bxc3)
   - Caro-Kann Advance (doubled f-pawns)
   - IQP positions after trades

### Test Suites
- STS positions 091-100 (doubled pawn specific)
- Arasan doubled pawn positions
- Custom validation suite

## Key Learnings from Expert Consultation

### Critical Implementation Points
1. **Avoid double-counting**: Process evaluation in order: Passed → Isolated → Backward → Doubled
2. **Handle multiple pawns**: Use popcount per file, not pairwise detection
3. **Performance matters**: Pre-calculate file masks, use pawn hash
4. **Simple is better**: Stockfish found complex evaluation performed worse

### Common Mistakes to Avoid
- Not handling triple/quadruple pawns
- Double-counting with isolated pawns  
- Ignoring pawn advancement differences
- Treating all files equally
- Using inefficient shift operations

### Insights from Top Engines
- **Stockfish**: -11 mg/-4 eg, file-based scaling, special case for supported doubled
- **Berserk**: -18 mg/-8 eg, considers square control, scales by rank distance
- **Obsidian**: -12 mg/-5 eg, tracks pawn majority, king proximity matters
- **Ethereal**: -15 mg/-7 eg, clean separation of front/rear pawns

## Risk Factors
1. **Performance regression**: Mitigate with efficient bitboard operations
2. **Interaction bugs**: Test thoroughly with isolated/backward pawns
3. **Over-penalization**: Start conservative, tune with SPSA
4. **Hash pollution**: Ensure proper pawn hash integration

## Success Criteria
- [ ] All phases compile without warnings
- [ ] Detection accurately identifies doubled pawns
- [ ] Performance impact < 2% 
- [ ] +15-25 ELO gain in Phase DP3
- [ ] No regression in tactical strength
- [ ] Clean integration with existing pawn evaluation
