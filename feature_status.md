# Feature Status: Pawn Islands

## Overview
**Feature:** Pawn Islands Evaluation  
**Branch:** feature/20250823-pawn-islands  
**Expected ELO:** +10-15  
**Start Date:** 2025-08-23  
**Base Commit:** a153dcf  

## Feature Description
Pawn islands are groups of connected pawns separated by files without pawns. Having fewer pawn islands generally indicates better pawn structure, as connected pawns can defend each other. This feature will count pawn islands and apply a penalty based on the count.

## Dependencies
- Builds on existing pawn structure evaluation
- Uses pawn hash table for caching
- Requires isolated pawn concept already implemented

## Implementation Plan

### Phase PI1: Infrastructure (0 ELO expected)
- Add pawn island counting logic to pawn structure
- Create data structures but don't integrate into evaluation
- Expected: No ELO change, validates compilation and structure
- Risk: None

### Phase PI2: Basic Integration (+5-8 ELO expected)
- Integrate island counting into pawn evaluation
- Apply simple linear penalty for island count
- Start with conservative penalty values
- Expected: Small positive gain
- Risk: May conflict with existing pawn penalties

### Phase PI3: Tuning & Refinement (+5-7 ELO additional expected)
- Tune penalty values based on game phase
- Consider special cases (3 vs 4 islands, etc.)
- Optimize caching in pawn hash
- Expected: Additional gains from tuning
- Risk: Over-tuning may cause regression

## Phase Status

| Phase | Status | Commit | Bench | Test Result | Notes |
|-------|--------|--------|-------|-------------|-------|
| PI1   | Complete | 06e4298 | 19191913 | AWAITING TEST | Infrastructure only |
| PI2   | Not Started | - | - | - | Basic integration |
| PI3   | Not Started | - | - | - | Tuning phase |

## Testing Summary

**Current Status:** Phase PI1 Complete - AWAITING OPENBENCH TEST

## Key Learnings
- (Will be updated as implementation progresses)

## Implementation Details

### Technical Approach
1. **Counting Algorithm:**
   - Iterate through files a-h
   - When a pawn is found, mark it and all connected pawns as visited
   - Increment island counter for each unvisited group
   - Cache result in pawn hash table

2. **Evaluation Terms:**
   - Base penalty per island (beyond the first)
   - Phase-dependent scaling (more important in endgame)
   - Consider isolated pawns as separate islands

3. **Integration Points:**
   - `src/evaluation/pawns.cpp` - Main implementation
   - `src/evaluation/pawn_hash.h` - Cache structure update
   - `src/evaluation/evaluation.cpp` - Integration point

## Risk Mitigation
- Keep phases small and testable
- Test each phase with OpenBench
- Monitor for conflicts with existing pawn terms
- Be conservative with initial values
