# Feature Implementation Status

## Isolated Pawns Evaluation Feature

### Overview
Implementing isolated pawns detection and evaluation for SeaJay chess engine. 
An isolated pawn is a pawn with no friendly pawns on adjacent files.
These pawns are generally weak because they cannot be protected by other pawns.
Target: +11-19 ELO gain (revised based on expert engine analysis).

### Implementation Timeline
- **Started:** 2025-08-22
- **Branch:** `feature/20250822-isolated-pawns`
- **Base Branch:** `main` (commit `1767f20`)

### Phase Status and Results

#### Phase IP1: Infrastructure & Detection
- **Commit:** ca4416a
- **Bench:** 19191913
- **Test Result:** +2.88 Â± 10.43 ELO (2534 games)
- **Status:** PASSED âœ“
- **Expected:** 0 ELO (infrastructure only)

#### Phase IP2: Basic Integration
- **Commit:** 17ab5f8
- **Bench:** 19191913
- **Test Result:** +14.84 Â± 10.92 ELO (2554 games) ðŸŽ‰
- **Status:** PASSED âœ“
- **Expected:** +8-12 ELO (revised)

#### Phase IP3: Refinements
- **Commit:** TBD
- **Bench:** TBD
- **Test Result:** TBD
- **Status:** NOT STARTED
- **Expected:** +3-7 ELO additional (revised)

### Testing Summary Table

| Phase | Feature | ELO vs Main | Status |
|-------|---------|-------------|---------|
| IP1 | Infrastructure | +2.88 Â± 10.43 | PASSED âœ“ |
| IP2 | Basic penalties | +14.84 Â± 10.92 | PASSED âœ“ |
| IP3a | File adjustments | +25.08 Â± 11.02 | PASSED âœ“ **BEST** |
| IP3b | Opposition detection | +7.43 Â± 11.19 | Regression (reverted) |

### Final Decision
**Selected Version:** IP3a (commit c41a595)
- **Total ELO Gain:** +25.08 Â± 11.02 vs main
- **Reason:** Best performing version. IP3b's opposition detection caused regression.

### Key Design Decisions

1. **Detection Method:** Check adjacent files for friendly pawns
2. **Penalty Values:** Start with -15cp base, scale by rank
3. **Phase Scaling:** Less penalty in endgame (isolated pawns less weak)
4. **Caching:** Store in existing pawn hash table

### Implementation Notes

- Isolated pawns are weaker in middlegame than endgame
- Central isolated pawns (d/e files) may be less weak if controlling key squares
- Should integrate cleanly with existing pawn structure code
- Use same pawn hash infrastructure as passed pawns

### Next Steps
1. Implement detection in pawn_structure.cpp
2. Add basic penalties in evaluate.cpp
3. Test and tune values
4. Consider phase-based adjustments
