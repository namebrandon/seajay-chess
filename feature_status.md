# SeaJay Time Management Fix - Feature Implementation Status

## Overview
**Branch**: `feature/20250825-game-analysis`  
**Base**: `main` (commit 5c593c0)  
**Purpose**: Fix critical time management issues causing severe search depth deficit (10-11 ply vs opponents' 19-22 ply)

## Problem Statement
Based on investigation report (`seajay_investigation_report.md`), SeaJay exhibits:
- **CRITICAL**: 10-12 ply search depth deficit compared to 3000+ ELO engines
- **ROOT CAUSE**: Premature search termination at 40% time usage
- **IMPACT**: Missing tactics 8-12 moves deep, 171+ huge blunders, 0% win rate vs strong engines

## Implementation Plan

### Phase 1: Critical Time Management Fix [IN PROGRESS]
**Expected Impact**: +5-8 ply depth, +100-200 ELO

#### Phase 1a: Remove 40% Early Exit Rule ✅ COMPLETE - 🧪 TESTING
- **Commit**: e4ba74c
- **Bench**: 19191913
- **Changes**: 
  - Removed the overly conservative 40% time limit check (`elapsed * 5 > timeLimit * 2`)
  - Now uses hard time limit to determine when to stop
  - Added logging to show soft/hard limits for debugging
- **Status**: Pushed to origin, SPRT testing in progress
- **SPRT Bounds**: [-5.00, 15.00] (expecting major gain)
- **Test Results (IN PROGRESS)**:
  - **10+0.1 TC**: Elo +6.72 ± 9.39 (95%), LLR 0.79 (-2.94, 2.94) [0.00, 5.00]
    - Games: 2948 (W: 1046, L: 989, D: 913)
    - Underwhelming but positive at fast time controls

#### Phase 1b: Implement Soft Limit Time Management ✅ COMPLETE - 🧪 TESTING
- **Commit**: 6c6c623
- **Bench**: 19191913
- **Changes**:
  - Added intelligent soft limit checking
  - Stop at soft limit when depth >= 6 (reasonable minimum)
  - Added debug logging for time management decisions
  - Always respect hard limit as absolute boundary
- **Status**: Pushed to origin, SPRT testing in progress
- **SPRT Bounds**: [0.00, 8.00]
- **Test Results (IN PROGRESS)**:
  - **60+0.6 TC**: Elo -5.07 ± 16.34 (95%), LLR -0.42 (-2.94, 2.94) [0.00, 5.00]
    - Games: 1164 (W: 407, L: 424, D: 333)
    - Test URL: https://openbench.seajay-chess.dev/test/196/
    - Showing regression at longer time controls - may need adjustment

#### Phase 1c: Add Predictive Time Management ⏳ PENDING
- **Goal**: Predict if there's time for next iteration using EBF
- **Changes Planned**:
  - Calculate effective branching factor from previous iterations
  - Predict next iteration time: `lastTime * EBF`
  - Don't start iteration if predicted time exceeds limits
- **Expected Impact**: Avoid incomplete iterations, better time usage

### Phase 2: Implement Search Extensions [PLANNED]
**Expected Impact**: +2-3 ply effective depth, +50-100 ELO

#### Phase 2a: Check Extensions
- Extend search by 1 ply when in check
- Critical for tactical accuracy

#### Phase 2b: One-Reply Extensions  
- Extend when only one legal move available
- Helps with forced sequences

#### Phase 2c: Singular Extensions (optional)
- Extend when one move is significantly better than alternatives
- More complex, may defer to later

**SPRT Bounds**: [0.00, 8.00] for each sub-phase

### Phase 3: Refine LMR [PLANNED]
**Expected Impact**: +1-2 ply effective depth, +30-50 ELO

#### Phase 3a: Implement Logarithmic Reduction Table
- Replace linear reduction with logarithmic formula
- Better scaling with depth and move count

#### Phase 3b: Add LMR Conditions
- Don't reduce killer moves
- Don't reduce moves with good history scores
- Reduce less in PV nodes

#### Phase 3c: Improving/Non-improving Logic
- Track if position is improving
- Reduce more when not improving

**SPRT Bounds**: [0.00, 5.00] for each sub-phase

### Phase 4: Advanced Pruning [PLANNED]
**Expected Impact**: +1 ply depth, +20-40 ELO

- Futility Pruning
- Razoring
- Move Count Pruning

**SPRT Bounds**: [0.00, 5.00]

### Phase 5: Move Ordering Optimization [PLANNED]
**Expected Impact**: Better node efficiency, +10-20 ELO

- Add followup history
- Piece-square ordering for quiet moves
- Tune history decay and bonus values

**SPRT Bounds**: [0.00, 5.00]

## Testing Protocol

### OpenBench Configuration
- **Dev Branch**: feature/20250825-game-analysis
- **Base Branch**: main
- **Time Control**: 10+0.1 (standard) or 60+0.6 (complex features)
- **Book**: UHO_4060_v2.epd

### Verification Methods
1. **Depth Check**: Verify reaching 15+ ply after Phase 1
2. **Time Usage**: Check using 70-80% of allocated time (vs current 40%)
3. **Tactical Tests**: Run tactical test suite to verify improvements

## Key Files Modified
- `/workspace/src/search/negamax.cpp` - Main search algorithm with time management

## Critical Code Sections

### Original Problem (Line 1123-1125)
```cpp
// BUG: Stops at 40% of time limit
if (elapsed * 5 > info.timeLimit * 2) {  // elapsed > 40% of limit
    break;
}
```

### Phase 1a Fix
```cpp
// Never start an iteration that would exceed hard limit
if (elapsed >= hardLimit) {
    break;
}
```

### Phase 1b Enhancement
```cpp
// Check soft limit with position stability consideration
if (elapsed >= softLimit && depth >= 6) {
    std::cerr << "[Time Management] Stopping at depth " << depth 
              << " - reached soft limit at reasonable depth\n";
    break;
}
```

## Success Metrics

### Phase 1 Expected Results
- **Search Depth**: 10-11 ply → 15-18 ply
- **Time Usage**: 40% → 70-80%
- **ELO Gain**: +100-200
- **Tactical Awareness**: Significant reduction in blunders

### Overall Project Goals
- **Depth Parity**: Reach 18-20 ply to match strong engines
- **Time Efficiency**: Use 80-90% of allocated time
- **ELO Target**: +200-300 total gain
- **Tactical Strength**: Eliminate massive blunders

## Test Results Analysis

### Phase 1 Early Results
The initial test results suggest:

1. **Phase 1a (10+0.1)**: Small positive gain (+6.72 ELO) at fast time controls
   - The removal of 40% limit may not have much impact at very fast TCs where depth is naturally limited
   - Underwhelming compared to expected +100-200 ELO

2. **Phase 1b (60+0.6)**: Small regression (-5.07 ELO) at longer time controls  
   - The soft limit at depth 6 might be too restrictive
   - May be stopping too early even when time is available
   - The regression suggests our soft limit logic needs refinement

### Potential Issues to Investigate
- Soft limit depth threshold (6) may be too low for longer time controls
- Missing the predictive time management (Phase 1c) may cause poor decisions
- The hard limit only approach might be too simplistic without EBF prediction

## Notes and Observations

### Build System
- Use regular cmake build, NOT OpenBench Makefile (has AVX2/AVX512 flags)
- Build command: `cd build && cmake .. && make seajay`
- Binary location: `/workspace/build/seajay`
- Bench command: `echo "bench" | ./build/seajay`

### Git Workflow
- Every phase must be pushed to origin immediately after commit
- Bench count MUST be in exact format: `bench 19191913`
- Use descriptive commit messages with expected impact and SPRT bounds

### Current Status
- **Phase 1a & 1b**: Complete and pushed, awaiting SPRT testing
- **Next Step**: Wait for human validation via OpenBench SPRT
- **If Successful**: Continue with Phase 1c
- **If Failed**: Debug and create smaller sub-phases

## Quick Reference Commands

```bash
# Build
cd /workspace/build && cmake .. && make seajay

# Get bench count
echo "bench" | ./build/seajay 2>&1 | grep "Benchmark complete" | awk '{print $4}'

# Commit with bench
git commit -m "feat: Description

Details...

bench 19191913"

# Push to origin
git push origin feature/20250825-game-analysis
```

## Risk Factors
1. **Build Issues**: CMake environment has some instabilities
2. **Bench Consistency**: Must ensure bench count doesn't change unexpectedly
3. **Time Management Complexity**: More sophisticated logic may have edge cases

## Lessons Learned
1. Small, incremental changes are easier to test and debug
2. Always include bench count in exact format for OpenBench
3. Push to origin immediately after each phase
4. Document expected impacts and SPRT bounds for testing
