# Continuation Prompt for UCI Regression Investigation

If we get disconnected, use this prompt to continue:

---

## Context
I'm investigating a -40 ELO regression in SeaJay chess engine caused by UCI score conversion. Please read `/workspace/branch_status.md` for full investigation history.

## Current Status
We're on branch `fix/uci-regression-clean` testing granular changes to isolate which part of UCI conversion causes the regression.

### Key Findings So Far
1. **Baseline (good):** Commit 855c4b9 - No regression
2. **Problem commit:** 7f646e4 - Introduced UCI conversion, caused -40 ELO loss
3. **Confirmed:** Disabling ALL UCI conversion (e385033) removes regression completely
4. **Testing now:** Two granular tests to isolate the issue:
   - `fix/test-centipawn-only` (9480ac9) - Tests ONLY centipawn conversion
   - `fix/test-mate-only` (38e78ec) - Tests ONLY mate score conversion

## Files to Review
- `/workspace/branch_status.md` - Complete investigation history
- `/workspace/src/uci/info_builder.cpp` - Where UCI conversion happens
- `/workspace/src/search/negamax.cpp` - Where info functions are called

## Next Steps Needed

### If both tests show no regression:
The problem is the interaction between centipawn and mate conversion. We need to test them together but with correct `rootSideToMove`.

### If centipawn test shows regression:
Focus on the line `if (sideToMove == BLACK) cp = -cp;` 
- Check if we're passing the correct sideToMove
- Verify scores are in negamax perspective before conversion
- Test alternative conversion approaches

### If mate test shows regression:
Focus on `int uciMateIn = (sideToMove == WHITE) ? mateIn : -mateIn;`
- Check mate score calculation
- Verify mate distance calculations

### If both show regression:
The `sideToMove` parameter itself is wrong throughout. Need to trace where it comes from.

## Important Notes
1. **Bench must stay 19191913** - Any change means we broke something
2. **Don't repeat:** c75a2e4 already tried rootSideToMove fix
3. **OpenBench is not the problem** - It works with world-class engines
4. **The regression is real** - It's not a testing artifact

## How to Continue
1. Check test results from OpenBench
2. Based on results, create new granular test commits
3. Each commit should change ONE thing
4. Always test against baseline 855c4b9
5. Update branch_status.md with findings

## Critical Insight
The fact that disabling UCI conversion completely fixes the issue proves the bug is in our UCI implementation, not in the search or evaluation. The challenge is finding exactly which part of the conversion is wrong.

Please help me continue debugging this regression by creating the next set of test commits based on the test results.
