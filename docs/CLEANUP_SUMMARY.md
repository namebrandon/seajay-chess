# SeaJay Codebase Cleanup Summary

## Cleanup Completed: August 2025

### What Was Done

1. **Root Directory Cleanup**
   - Removed ~60+ debug/test files and compiled binaries
   - Removed temporary Python scripts and test reports
   - Kept only essential project files (README, LICENSE, CMakeLists, etc.)

2. **Test Organization**
   - Kept essential test files in `/workspace/tests/`
   - Removed redundant debug and analysis files
   - Preserved:
     - `perft/perft_test.cpp` - Main perft validation
     - `perft/perft_divide.cpp` - Perft breakdown analysis
     - `unit/` - All unit tests for board and FEN
     - `demo/` - Demonstration programs
     - `uci_protocol_tests.sh` - UCI testing suite

3. **Tools Organization**
   - Created `/workspace/tools/debugging/` for perft debug tool
   - Added comprehensive README.md documenting all tools
   - Preserved setup scripts in `/workspace/tools/scripts/`

4. **Documentation Updates**
   - Updated main README.md with current Stage 3 completion status
   - Moved UCI_USAGE_GUIDE.md to `/workspace/docs/`
   - Moved development summaries to `/workspace/docs/development/`

### Known Issues Documented

1. **Bug #001**: Position 3 perft discrepancy (0.026% error)
   - Documented in `/workspace/project_docs/tracking/known_bugs.md`
   - Debugging tool available in `/workspace/tools/debugging/perft_debug`

2. **Bug #002**: Checkmate detection in edge cases
   - Identified during UCI testing
   - To be addressed in Phase 2

### What's Ready

- ✅ Engine is playable via UCI interface
- ✅ 99.974% accurate move generation
- ✅ Clean, organized codebase
- ✅ Comprehensive documentation
- ✅ Testing infrastructure in place

### Next Steps

1. **Stage 5**: Set up fast-chess and SPRT testing
2. **Phase 2**: Begin search and evaluation implementation
3. **Bug Fixes**: Address known issues when convenient

The codebase is now clean, well-organized, and ready for continued development!
