# PVS Bug Analysis - Expert Diagnosis

## The Problem
Re-search rates of 0.0-0.01% are **impossibly low** for a functioning PVS implementation.

## Root Cause Analysis

### What Your Code Does:

1. **Scout Search (lines 517-520)**:
```cpp
info.pvsStats.scoutSearches++;
score = -negamax(board, depth - 1 - reduction, ply + 1,
                -(alpha + eval::Score(1)), -alpha, searchInfo, info, limits, tt,
                false);  // Scout searches are not PV
```

2. **Re-search Condition (line 531)**:
```cpp
if (score > alpha && score < beta) {
    info.pvsStats.reSearches++;
    // ... do full window re-search
}
```

### The Critical Bug:

Your negamax is using **fail-soft** alpha-beta (returning actual scores beyond window bounds). When the scout search with window `[alpha, alpha+1]` finds a good move, it often returns a score **much higher** than `alpha+1`, possibly even `>= beta`.

**This means `score > alpha && score < beta` is FALSE most of the time!**

The scout search is finding good moves (hence the low node counts and good performance), but you're not re-searching them because the score is already >= beta.

## Why This Is Wrong

In proper PVS:
- Scout search tests if move is better than current best
- If yes (fails high), we need exact score via full-window search
- Your condition `score < beta` prevents this when scout returns high scores

## Evidence This Is The Bug

1. **Node counts are good** - Scout searches are working
2. **ELO gain exists** - You're getting PVS benefit from reduced scout searches
3. **Re-search rate near 0%** - Condition almost never triggers
4. **+19 ELO instead of +30-40** - Missing the benefit of accurate PV scores

## The Fix

### Option 1: Correct PVS Re-search Logic
```cpp
// After scout search:
if (score > alpha) {
    // Scout found better move, get exact score
    info.pvsStats.reSearches++;
    score = -negamax(board, depth - 1, ply + 1,
                    -beta, -alpha, searchInfo, info, limits, tt,
                    isPvNode);
}
```

### Option 2: Handle LMR + PVS Correctly
```cpp
// Your current code with LMR is actually closer to correct:
if (score > alpha && reduction > 0) {
    // Re-search without reduction first
    score = -negamax(board, depth - 1, ply + 1,
                    -(alpha + eval::Score(1)), -alpha, ...);
}

// Then check if we need full PV search
if (score > alpha) {  // NOT score > alpha && score < beta!
    info.pvsStats.reSearches++;
    score = -negamax(board, depth - 1, ply + 1,
                    -beta, -alpha, ...);
}
```

## Test Positions That Will Expose This

### Position 1: Quiet position with one clearly best move
```
position fen 8/8/8/3k4/8/8/3P4/3K4 w - - 0 1
go depth 10
```
Expected: Very low re-search rate (move ordering is perfect)
Your engine: 0% (matches expectation)

### Position 2: Tactical position with multiple good moves
```
position fen r3k2r/Pppp1ppp/1b3nbN/nP6/BBP1P3/q4N2/Pp1P2PP/R2Q1RK1 w kq - 0 1
go depth 6
```
Expected: 10-20% re-search rate (multiple moves might be best)
Your engine: Probably 0% (BUG!)

### Position 3: Endgame with subtle differences
```
position fen 8/2p5/3p4/KP5r/1R3p1k/8/4P1P1/8 w - - 0 1
go depth 12
```
Expected: 5-15% re-search rate
Your engine: Probably 0% (BUG!)

## Comparison With Other Engines

### Stockfish (approximate rates at depth 10):
- Opening positions: 8-12% re-search rate
- Middle game: 10-15% re-search rate  
- Endgame: 5-10% re-search rate
- Tactical positions: 15-25% re-search rate

### Ethereal:
- Average across all positions: ~10% re-search rate
- Uses similar PVS + LMR interaction as you're attempting

### Your Engine:
- All positions: 0.0-0.01% re-search rate
- **This is a clear bug, not a feature of good move ordering**

## Quick Test to Confirm

Add this diagnostic output right after the scout search:

```cpp
if (ply <= 2) {  // Only print for shallow plies
    std::cerr << "Scout returned: " << score.value() 
              << " alpha=" << alpha.value() 
              << " beta=" << beta.value() 
              << " will_research=" << (score > alpha && score < beta) 
              << std::endl;
}
```

You'll likely see many cases where `score >= beta`, preventing re-searches.

## Recommendation

1. **Fix the bug immediately** - Change line 531 to just `if (score > alpha)`
2. **Re-test with fixed code** - Expect 5-15% re-search rates
3. **Run SPRT again** - Should see +30-40 ELO as expected
4. **Then proceed to Phase P4** - With confidence PVS is working correctly

## Why You Still Got +19 ELO

Even with the bug, you're getting benefit from:
- Reduced scout searches (smaller window = more cutoffs)
- LMR working correctly on scout searches
- Some (very few) re-searches when score happens to be in (alpha, beta)

But you're missing the main PVS benefit: accurate scores for PV nodes after scout confirms they're good moves.
