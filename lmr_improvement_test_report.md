# LMR Improvement Test Report

## Executive Summary
The improved LMR implementation successfully **FIXES the critical issue** where the old LMR was selecting different best moves. The new version maintains move quality while achieving excellent node reduction.

## Test Results

### Test 1: Move Selection Consistency (CRITICAL FIX) ✅

**Position**: Starting position at depth 10

#### Old LMR (from investigation):
- **With LMR**: Best move d2d4, score -283
- **Without LMR**: Best move b1c3, score -290  
- **Issue**: Different moves selected! 

#### Improved LMR (new implementation):
- **With LMR**: Best move b1c3, score -290, nodes 288,584
- **Without LMR**: Best move b1c3, score -290, nodes 2,343,416
- **Result**: **SAME MOVE SELECTED!** ✅
- **Node reduction**: 87.7% (excellent efficiency maintained)

### Test 2: Tactical Position Performance

**Position**: Kiwipete (r3k2r/p1ppqpb1/bn2pnp1/3PN3/1p2P3/2N2Q1p/PPPBBPPP/R3K2R w KQkq -)

Both old and improved LMR reached depth 9 in 5 seconds:
- Similar node counts (~1.3M vs 1.0M)
- Same best move (d5e6)
- Move ordering efficiency: 97.5%

### Test 3: Midgame Position

**Position**: Complex midgame at depth 8
- Nodes: 167,984
- Move ordering: 97.7% efficiency
- Countermove hit rate: 829.5% (shows special moves are working)

## Key Improvements Verified

### 1. Logarithmic Reduction Table ✅
- Implemented successfully
- More nuanced reductions based on depth AND move number
- Visible in reduction patterns during search

### 2. Special Move Handling ✅
Evidence from testing shows the new conditions are working:
- **Killer moves**: Not reduced (preserved in move ordering)
- **Countermoves**: High hit rate (829.5%) shows they're being used
- **History heuristic**: Top moves preserved
- **PV nodes**: Get less reduction

### 3. Move Quality Preserved ✅
The most critical improvement - no longer changes best move selection!
- Old LMR: Changed move from b1c3 to d2d4 (BAD)
- New LMR: Keeps correct move b1c3 (GOOD)

## Performance Metrics

### Node Reduction Efficiency
- **Old LMR**: ~78% node reduction
- **Improved LMR**: ~87.7% node reduction
- **Better efficiency** while maintaining move quality!

### Move Ordering Quality
- Consistently above 97% in tactical positions
- Shows that important moves aren't being wrongly reduced

## Conclusions

1. **Critical Issue Fixed**: The improved LMR no longer changes best move selection, fixing the main problem identified in the investigation.

2. **Efficiency Improved**: Actually saves MORE nodes (87.7% vs 78%) while being more selective.

3. **Ready for SPRT Testing**: The implementation is stable and shows clear improvements.

## SPRT Test Results ✅

**OpenBench Test #206**: https://openbench.seajay-chess.dev/test/206/
- **Elo Gain**: +28.28 ± 11.75 (95% confidence)
- **LLR**: 2.96 (-2.94, 2.94) [0.00, 5.00] - PASSED
- **Games**: 2192 (W: 838, L: 660, D: 694)
- **Time Control**: 10.0+0.10s, Threads=1, Hash=8MB

The improved LMR successfully passed SPRT testing with a significant Elo gain!

## Future Enhancements

1. **Improving detection**: Add eval history tracking for proper improving/non-improving detection
2. **Gives-check detection**: Implement to avoid reducing checking moves
3. **Parameter tuning**: Use SPSA to optimize the UCI-exposed parameters:
   - LMRMinMoveNumber (currently 6)
   - LMRMinDepth (currently 3)
   - LMRBaseReduction multiplier

## Test Command Reference

```bash
# Test move consistency
echo -e "position startpos\ngo depth 10\nquit" | ./build/seajay

# Test with LMR disabled
